To get to Perth I flew through Toronto , Tokyo and Singapore. </p>
<p class="auto-style29">
We crossed over the Kamchatka peninsula in Siberia , it was all ice and snow.</p>

Coming into Japan when we crossed green mountains norteast of Tokyo , I realised 
some coastal areas below me were probably destroyed by the huge tidal waves one 
year ago.</p>

When we landed at Narita we taxied in from an outlying runway, the plane 
literally passed through suburbs close to the fence, farm crops were only feet 
away from the wing tips. I could look into workshops and garages fixing cars, 
they were that close.<o:p></o:p></p>

	<p>After a very full air canada plane for 12 hours I <span class="auto-style22">&nbsp;boarded an Eastern 
	airlines flight to Singapore. It was running at 30% capacity and that was 
	due to a scare targeting Americans , so people were avoiding their planes. 
	Not bad, I could sleep across four seats for a few hours. In Singapore well 
	rested I boarded Singapore</span> airlines to Perth, it was standing room only.&nbsp;</p>

	It had been 30 years since I was in west Australia and I knew Perth would 
	look a lot different from those days.&nbsp; My son Arran picked me up at the 
	airport and we went to his house in Fremantle. I could smell the gum trees 
	when I got out , that eucalyptus fragrance which is unique. Fremantle is 
	close to the beaches that run north along the Perth oceanfront suburbs.&nbsp; 
	Arran is a keen surfer and would show me some of his favourite places.&nbsp;</div>

	&nbsp;One day he surfed at Cottesloe beach and I took photos. <br>It was early

I was given 10 days to get it home. The owner Dave xxx is a great guy and runs a 
full selection of bikes from his shop, touring, adventure and off road. He flew 
out to Perth to prep my bike as the German rider had gone into the bush at speed 
on the nullarbor. Luckily the damage was only cosmetic, destroyed the right bag, 
windshield and mirror. Some road rash on the valve cover but no leaks. I picked 
up an extra kayak bag to make up for the missing hard case.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

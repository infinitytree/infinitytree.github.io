to </font><font color="#33FF33">Cape Breton Island</font><font color="#66FFFF">
, nice sunny day. The night before I decided to catch the midnight ferry
to </font><font color="#FF0000">Newfoundland from North Sydney</font><font color="#66FFFF">
so I had a whole day to kill ...... why not ride the famous </font><font color="#FFFF00">Cabot
Trail </font><font color="#66FFFF">again.&nbsp; Went around clockwise,
my preferred direction.... started at the </font><font color="#99FF99">Canso

Hood</font><font color="#66FFFF"> to </font><font color="#FF6666">Cheticamp</font><font color="#66FFFF">.
The west coast seems to have less traffic usually, you can make better
time to the Trail on it and the road is good&nbsp; for the most part, very
few rough sections.&nbsp; Got into the&nbsp; scenic twisties north of Cheticamp
where the park begins. Lots of bikers on the trail, many Harleys from west
and the US this year. I met two locals&nbsp; on beemers,&nbsp; a </font><font color="#FF0000">red

This stretch up to </font><font color="#33FF33">French Mountain</font><font color="#FFFF00">

.&nbsp; The factory flew 4 new cars to </font><font color="#FFCCCC">Vancouver

them on a car transporter. The director drove east looking for the perfect
location,&nbsp; Calgary........ no,&nbsp;&nbsp; prairies ........ no,&nbsp;
Ontario.........still&nbsp; no ,&nbsp; Cabot Trail .......&nbsp; ok guys,
leave the cars on the truck and don't stop until you get to Nova Scotia
!&nbsp;&nbsp; Later we needed interior shots of the car........&nbsp;&nbsp;
no problem,&nbsp; the French mechanic cut one car&nbsp; in half right behind
the driver's seat....... took him about 4 hours. He told me he had worked
for </font><font color="#33CCFF">Fiat, Citroen and Renault</font><font color="#FFFF00">
filming on every continent.... this was probably the tenth car he had cut
through&nbsp; .&nbsp; Paid to play !&nbsp; He brazed it back together for

I continued north across the highlands up to </font><font color="#33FF33">Pleasant

on&nbsp; for Detroit .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stripped the doors, bumpers,
seats, and rear box&nbsp; off it, then we flew&nbsp; the chassis up the

helicopter</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp; The second trip we took&nbsp;
all the pieces in a cargo net, then we reassembled it on the summit.&nbsp;
Had a few gallons in the tank so we could drive it around up there on the
flat area, then filmed it&nbsp; from a second helicopter. An&nbsp; </font><font color="#C0C0C0">airforce

valley about 300 ft below our level, I bet he never figured that one out

around, 135mm lens..... moose are not this easy to get on film, lucky day.&nbsp;

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Made it into </font><font color="#66FFFF">North Sydney</font><font color="#FFFF00">
at 8 pm, no trouble getting a ticket for me and the bike, the ferries are
huge.&nbsp; Tied the bike down&nbsp; with about </font><font color="#00CC00">8
other bikes</font><font color="#FFFF00"> at the stern of the ship. About
$ 53&nbsp; for the 6 hr trip. Found a piece of carpet in the lounge like
many others, and sacked out on the thermarest pad, great sleep, no sea
swells to speak of.</font></font></font>

up to more sun, drove off the boat at 7:30.&nbsp; Drove around </font><font color="#FF9900">Port

towns that early in the morning. Neat little streets all over town, mostly
dead ends like so many </font><font color="#66FF99">ports in Nfld</font><font color="#66FFFF">.
Took this photo from the end of one lane looking back at the ferry dock.
Found a restaurant and had breakfast, then a shave and wash&nbsp; .</font></font></font>

nice winding&nbsp; road that follows the coast, very little traffic. Rolling
barren lands with trees in the gullies.&nbsp; Went forty five kms to </font><font color="#FFCCCC">Rose

the slope from the ocean with granite rocks in them for the path borders.
One would push while a couple others dragged her behind them&nbsp; with

for a corner store. Met a nice lady running the local grocery, had a good
yarn with her for a while.&nbsp; She had just got a new paved road to her

Next I drove down Rt 437 to </font><font color="#FFFF00">Raleigh and Cape
Onion</font><font color="#FF9900"> a few miles west.&nbsp; My next destination
were the only towns on the east coast accessible by road, </font><font color="#33FF33">Roddicton
and Englee.</font><font color="#FF9900">&nbsp; I went south to the St.
Anthony airport and took a new shortcut east to </font><font color="#FF0000">Main
Brook</font><font color="#FF9900"> about 30 kms away. It is a very fast
paved road in great condition.&nbsp; Then I hit it.......... a new stretch
of construction with the </font><font color="#66FFFF">killer 4 inch crusher
rock surface</font><font color="#FF9900">. There was 30 kms of this and
many dump trucks and excavators, some heavy sand ruts and big detours.
Put my mind back into </font><font color="#CC66CC">Alaska gear</font><font color="#FF9900">,
slowed down to the best speed and puckered up. Actually, it was quite fun
on the RS, I was even laughing a few times when it got crazy, front end
dancing left and right on the bigger crush rock.&nbsp; Just slow down and
enjoy the ride.&nbsp; The RS is no heavier than an off road GS, and handles
bad conditions with a shrug, as I found out again later in </font><font color="#33FF33">Labrador</font><font color="#FF9900">.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#99FF99">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It took almost an hour to get through to the pavement (about 20 miles away
) where&nbsp; RT 432&nbsp; joins&nbsp; 433, then it was easy running to</font><font color="#FF0000">
Roddicton</font><font color="#99FF99">, a busy logging centre. Gassed up,&nbsp;
ate some food and&nbsp; hit the road south to the coast at </font><font color="#66FFFF">Englee</font><font color="#99FF99">,
20 kms further.&nbsp; Small village, sheltered harbour. Found a graveyard
on the end of a point of land, put up the tent across the road on the&nbsp;
shoreline. Beautiful </font><font color="#FF0000">red sunset</font><font color="#99FF99">,

Then I hear stories of all the people he knows (living and passed on) who&nbsp;
have run into moose in cars, trucks&nbsp; and even bikes ( no thanks&nbsp;
). A common theme in Nfld, and part of the reason I drive very little at
night there when I can avoid it.&nbsp; A local friend once stopped at night
to help a </font><font color="#FF99FF">Miata sports car driver</font><font color="#FFCC33">
who was looking for his antenna by the road after&nbsp; cruising&nbsp;
under the </font><font color="#66FFFF">belly of a moose standing sideways</font><font color="#FFCC33">
. No other damage besides his nerves. These animals are huge, up to 1800
lbs , and parts of western&nbsp; Nfld have 7 per sq km, the highest density
in the world. There are 400,000 on the island, plus caribou. I sit and
eat, watching the&nbsp; sunset and listening to hundreds of seabirds nesting
offshore on a rocky island.&nbsp; More sleep.</font></font></font>

Back on the bike and head west 100 kms to the main coast road again near

where I stopped for food at a chip wagon. Fish and chips were $ 8 , and
I wasn't in the mood for chips, so I asked the lady if I could buy a couple
pieces of fish . She looked at me like I had just ruined her day, then
consulted with the cook. Ok.&nbsp; I must admit, that fish was the best
I have tasted in a long time.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Got to the entrance to </font><font color="#33FF33">Western Brook Pond</font><font color="#FFCC00">,
a huge fjord that has been cut off from the sea eons ago. The cliffs are
</font><font color="#FF0000">2000 ft high</font><font color="#FFCC00">
for miles, and the water is very deep. It is a 45 min walk in to the boat
dock on a nice boardwalk, but I was too late in the day for me to catch
the last trip. Remounted the bike and pushed on south. Here is a picture
from a helicopter job I did there the next month. I was operating a nose
mounted camera under the helicopter. We are at the far eastern end looking
toward the ocean to the west, about 2000 ft elevation. Our pilot Dave&nbsp;

their lights off at low speed, obviously looking for something....... </font><font color="#FFCCCC">I
was puzzled</font><font color="#99FF99">.&nbsp; Later, my helicopter pilot&nbsp;
told me that they were probably poaching ( which is highly illegal in the

left and I went to bed in my rock cul de sac.</font></font></font>

just how many bikes they had seen this summer. We left port and I waited
on a standby list for a cabin, but luckily for me there were none left.
The interior of the ship was overheated for my liking, and the 4 berth
cabins were very cramped from what I had seen, much smaller than the</font><font color="#33CCFF">
Nova Scotia to Nfld</font><font color="#FFFF00"> ferry run. It was clear
and starlit on deck, so I found a nice sheltered spot behind a vertical
steel wall about mid ships and laid out my thermo rest mattress and sleeping
bag on the steel plate. If the weather looked bad I would have considered
putting up the dome tent.&nbsp; It was a fantastic night, I watched </font><font color="#33FF33">satellites

in the shallows.&nbsp; In the distance they look huge with the heights

The stars are out and I put down my swag on the deck again for another

down at the front of the vehicles blocking the main ramp off. I get my

..... and onto the dirt we go.&nbsp; It is wide and well graded, no potholes
or ruts to speak of but plenty of gravel and dust.&nbsp; Better than I
expected .&nbsp; The crews have been working hard by the look of it.&nbsp;
I run for a half hour and enter a very sandy stretch of country,&nbsp;
still lots of trees, but almost a desert feel to the ground under them.
Big hills going down to creek crossings then back up. Road is still good.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#66FFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The odd vehicle passes me, and I pull off when the big trucks come the
other way, as the </font><font color="#33FF33">dust hangs for half a minute</font><font color="#66FFFF">
after they pass. </font><font color="#FF0000">It reminds me of the red

about </font><font color="#FFFF00">27 degs</font><font color="#66FFFF">
and it is only noon. I stop at a river and soak my T shirt then put it
on wet under the leather jacket. This is usually good for half an hour
or more, very comfortable.&nbsp; I try to watch the mirrors but get an
adrenaline rush heading up a steep hill from a bridge crossing when a </font><font color="#66FF99">car
blasts by at 100 kmph</font><font color="#66FFFF">.&nbsp; Not much warning

After a couple of hours I stop for a flag man, there are </font><font color="#66FF99">bulldozers</font><font color="#FF99FF">
and </font><font color="#FFFF00">big Cat dump trucks </font><font color="#FF99FF">blocking
the way. Shutting off the motor , I strip down to my T shirt to cool off
. A few of the heavy equipment guys wander over to chat. They tell me that
they are </font><font color="#FF0000">blasting</font><font color="#FF99FF">
a culvert up ahead on a side section and it will be a few minutes. Fine
by me, good chance to have a break. After the usual questions about where
I am from and my destination , I ask them how many bikes they have seen

replies one guy. My suspicions are confirmed , the news is not out yet
that the road is being upgraded.&nbsp; I pull out the camera and get a
shot of the big trucks. After ten minutes I get tired of waiting and put
it away..... too bad....&nbsp;</font><font color="#FFCCFF"> suddenly there
is a big bang and a shock wave&nbsp; concussion as the&nbsp; road up ahead

trundle along I can see that it will be a slow trip, but the dozer operator

The road has many dips and curves weaving around small lakes and ponds.&nbsp;
I stop for lunch by one of them and sit down on a sandy beach.&nbsp; Beside
me is a surprise, some of&nbsp; the biggest blueberry bushes I have seen,
hundreds of berries on each one. I am pulling them off in handfuls as the
motor home goes by and waves.&nbsp; Paradise.&nbsp; Reminds me of </font><font color="#FF0000">flying

Back on the road again. The conditions are not too bad, you do have to
pay attention to the loose stuff and pick your ruts , but it is not white
knuckle riding if you keep your speed down. About once every half hour
I get slightly out of shape on the gravel . . . .&nbsp; it is a good wake
up call to take it easy.&nbsp; </font><font color="#66FFFF">I average about
30 mph</font><font color="#FFCC33"> but the scenery is worth it.&nbsp;
I had visions of feeling very isolated on this road but it is turning out
to be a fun ride.&nbsp; </font><font color="#33FF33">I learned in Alaska
to take my time and go slower as conditions changed</font><font color="#FFCC33">,
you can get over almost anything with the right attitude and no urge to
rush. I think that is the hidden enemy on these trips, </font><font color="#FF0000">the
urge to get to safety the sooner the better, your speed goes up and your
chances of dropping the bike with it.</font><font color="#FFCC33">&nbsp;
The main area that gets tricky is crossing the gravel berm in mid road
to change ruts, the bike always feels loose and&nbsp; snaky, but if you
don't make any radical jabs on the bars it seems to find its own way over.&nbsp;
I guess every rider gets his own technique for this eventually. If I stop
to take a picture, cars&nbsp; often slow down to see if I need help.&nbsp;
I usually give them a thumbs up before they pass me, or they will have
to back up to talk after they stop.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#66FFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I pull into </font><font color="#33FF33">Churchill Falls</font><font color="#66FFFF">
about 5pm. </font><font color="#FFCC33">It has taken 6 hours to cover 288
kms.</font><font color="#66FFFF">&nbsp; I was probably off the bike for
an hour all told, so average speed is about 60 kmph.&nbsp; There is some
kind of strike by workers in progress, I see electrician pickets at some
industrial gates when I drive past. The local store / garage has regular
gas only, so I fill up. The lady behind the counter seems less friendly
than the average I have met, I guess having a monopoly does that. Just
another tourist....... I get the feeling if you don't work in that town
you are not of much interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I drive up behind the town onto
a long earth dam that stretches out forever holding back a southern arm
of the huge </font><font color="#FFFF99">Smallwood reservoir .&nbsp;</font><font color="#66FFFF">
Infront of me there are big transmission lines that feed power across a
deep valley and off towards</font><font color="#FF0000"> Quebec</font><font color="#66FFFF">.
The power plant is underground and since it is Sunday plus a major strike
at the gates I will not get a tour today. I wanted to see the largest underground
hydro power facility in the world, but the day is fading fast. I still
hope to take a chunk out of the 240 km stretch to </font><font color="#66FF99">Labrador&nbsp;
City.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FF9900">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Leave town and immediately I am on a better gravel highway, straight and
well maintained. </font><font color="#33FF33">There are still 3 main ruts
of hard pan between the furrows</font><font color="#FF9900">, but longer
straight stretches that allow 80 or 90 kmph in places.&nbsp; It is fairly
consistent, no big changes in elevation, no deep ravines with bridges at
the bottom, no sharp corners without warning.&nbsp; </font><font color="#66FFFF">For
a gravel road it is a gift on a bike.</font></font></font>
<p><img SRC="sunset.jpg" height=206 width=433>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I see a car every 20 minutes or so. After an hour I enter an strange area.
</font><font color="#C0C0C0">As far as the eye can see to every horizon
the forests have been burnt, all that's left are grey tree trunks for miles.</font><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;
I continue through the </font><font color="#CCFFFF">Big Burn </font><font color="#FFFF00">as
I call it for at least half an hour doing 70 to 80 kmph !&nbsp; It looks
like an older fire, sometime in the last ten years. The fires I saw in
the </font><font color="#FF0000">Yukon</font><font color="#FFFF00"> last
summer are mere babies compared to this one. From the air it must be even
more impressive.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#99FF99">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It has become overcast and the light is falling fast, so I pull off on
the gravel shoulder by a lake.&nbsp;&nbsp; I put my tent up on the shoulder
of the road where there is a wider stretch because there are no easy spots
in the woods to get too, mostly marsh and bog or old tree debris. </font><font color="#66FFFF">A
couple of 18 wheelers fly by heading east .&nbsp;</font><font color="#99FF99">

it used to be before the fire.</font></font></font>

I have never had to do more than 200 kms of dirt before in one stretch

bleak and industrial but has lots of gas stations and at least 2 hotels.

I watch the </font><font color="#FFFF00">big 150 ton Cat trucks</font><font color="#99FF99">
coming down the mine road on the other side of the fence to dump their
loads. Then I head onto the mud/dirt road again and the weather starts
to improve.&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF6666">I am now on the infamous
winding 70km stretch that follows the railway track south</font><font color="#99FF99">
and used to cross over&nbsp;&nbsp; about 15 times. Today there are only
8 crossings and the road seems almost enjoyable as it snakes around all
the lakes and rock outcrops.&nbsp; It is the twistiest stretch on the whole
trip, but the gravel seems well maintained.&nbsp; My friend did it years
ago when it was a demon, lots of sand in the hollows and bad rail crossings.&nbsp;
There are still sand warning flags planted every few turns, but nothing
bad I could feel under me.&nbsp; </font><font color="#FFCCCC">One of the
last crossings is blocked by a long work train laying down huge sections
of welded track beside the roadbed</font><font color="#99FF99">.&nbsp;
I stop and shed some clothes while one of the workmen comes over to talk.
It will take at least 20 minutes for the train to clear the level crossing.
He is surprised I started in Halifax and made it all the way from Goose
Bay.&nbsp; When they clear the road I have a big tanker truck behind me
so I pull over and give him a head start.&nbsp; They&nbsp; travel fast
on the dirt, and I don't need one breathing down my neck on this road .</font></font></font>

At </font><font color="#FF0000">Fire Lake </font><font color="#99FF99">the
pavement appears again, it is 90 kms of first class road to </font><font color="#FF99FF">Gagnon.</font><font color="#99FF99">&nbsp;
Speeds of 100 kms are easy to maintain, long straight stretches and good
corners. </font><font color="#FFFF00">The weather is bright but overcast</font><font color="#99FF99">,
road is dry.&nbsp; It feels like being on a race track after the last 2
days, and I open up&nbsp; the motor for the next hour. Traffic is still
rare.&nbsp; At the end of this stretch is the ghost town of </font><font color="#FF9900">Gagnon</font><font color="#99FF99">.....
or should I say ghost boulevard. There are no houses to be seen, but the
pavement becomes divided for a kilometer and the curb shows driveways at
regular intervals going into the grass on both sides. I believe they pulled
up the whole town when the local mine ran out, not a trace is left but
the gaps in the curb.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#99FF99">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><font color="#00CC00">From Gagnon I began the last piece of dirt
road</font><font color="#FFFF99">, and it turned out to be the worst. For
175 kms south to the pavement at </font><font color="#FF0000">Manic 5 dam</font><font color="#FFFF99">,
it was hard work.&nbsp; The rain had started again and there were many
hills to climb on this more narrow road. There seemed to be more dirt than
gravel in places, and going down steep hills into the bottom of unknown
mud/sand/gravel&nbsp; corners before you climbed back up again was&nbsp;
becoming a trip into the unknown. </font><font color="#FF99FF">A few times
I was on the verge of going down when I somehow recovered the snowplow
front end .</font><font color="#FFFF99"> The other problem with this stretch
is the corrugated hard packed bedrock in the ruts going uphill, and driving
left or right didn't seem to improve it. I just had to slow down and grit
my teeth.&nbsp; About 75kms down is the </font><font color="#33CCFF">Motel
Relais Gabriel</font><font color="#FFFF99">, a welcome pit stop. They have
rooms of sorts, food and gas.&nbsp; I peeled off my dripping rainsuit,&nbsp;
and let it hang on the porch. Inside I ordered a grilled cheese and bacon
sandwich in French , and enjoyed the peaceful view outside to the gas pumps.
Only a couple of cars came in to gas up while I was there.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF99">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><font color="#33CCFF">The rain had eased up as I continued south</font><font color="#33FF33">,
but the&nbsp;&nbsp; conditions were about the same. It is probably the
narrowest road I had been on, and going over the hills it is safer to stay
to the right as a&nbsp; precaution.&nbsp; I was looking forward to a motel
bed in </font><font color="#FF6666">Manic 5 </font><font color="#33FF33">where
I had to gas up, by then it would be 600 kms for the day.&nbsp; About supper
time I came off the dirt onto pavement and went down a steep hill past
the front of the dam. This is one of the most impressive dams I have seen
anywhere.</font></font></font>

pulled into the motel for gas.&nbsp; " No rooms left " the lady at the
cash told me.&nbsp; Well, so much for taking it easy tonight. I decided
to use the hour of daylight left to push hard towards Baie Comeau , 220
kms south on the St Lawrence River. Then when it got dark I would slow
down and maybe follow someone else's headlights.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#33FF33">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><font color="#FFFF00">This plan worked well, I had the road all

were a lot of log trucks going south loaded.</font><font color="#FFFF00">
By the time it got dark I had passed about 8 of these and decided to tuck
in behind a couple of cars who seemed to know every corner. Their headlights
made the next hour relatively easy and I did not have to worry so much
about animals getting in my path.&nbsp; </font><font color="#FFCCFF">I
used my 100 watt highbeam on the corners when the cars swept ahead of me
around a bend.</font><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp; It would be a nice ride

Luckily I made the trip without any punctures.&nbsp; One piece of advice
I would have is to carry a spare tube in case you get a flat on tubeless
tires ,&nbsp; and also ( but not only ) a good patch/plug&nbsp; kit with
CO2 cartridges.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will&nbsp; need a fail safe method to break
your tire bead if a plug doesn't work and a tube is needed.&nbsp; I carry
patches,&nbsp; an 18 inch tube which will do in either tire , and a Pro
Lev'r Tire Wizard .&nbsp; This unit is my choice to get a tire off any
rim&nbsp; in the boonies if you don't want to rely on a truck ride to the
next gas station.</font></font></font>

I made a few changes to the bike</font><font color="#CC6600"> before the
trip. Put on a tall&nbsp; </font><font color="#FFCC99">Parabellum windshield</font><font color="#CC6600">,
and a </font><font color="#33CCFF">leather Corbin&nbsp; seat.&nbsp;</font><font color="#CC6600">
Tried a set of bar backs earlier which didn’t give me the wrist angle I
wanted. Bought some billet alloy and machined a pair of my own design with
a built in </font><font color="#00CC00">ten degree twist</font><font color="#CC6600">
that rotated my wrists up higher, the same angle as my old </font><font color="#33CCFF">1980

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#CC6600"><font size=+1>I through
drilled them for stainless steel nuts/bolts that I could torque much tighter.
If I dropped the bike in the boonies, the bars should be easier to fix
than stripped aluminum threads in blind holes. Put on softer foam grips,
reduced what little vibration there was left. I tested grips by putting
two kinds on the bike together, your hands tell you which one feels better
pretty fast.</font></font></font>

My luggage was regular hard bags and a small </font><font color="#FF99FF">Krauser
top trunk</font><font color="#CC6600">, plus my tenting gear in a 30 liter
waterproof&nbsp; </font><font color="#FFCC00">Sealine kayak bag</font><font color="#CC6600">.
I carried a two man </font><font color="#3366FF">Kelty Vortex 2</font><font color="#CC6600">
tent ( good dome type rectangular tent ),&nbsp; a </font><font color="#009900">Thermo-rest
self inflating pad</font><font color="#CC6600"> , and a </font><font color="#FF0000">Woods
city 350 liteloft</font><font color="#CC6600"> bag that is rated to five
deg C and packs up about the size of a loaf of bread . This all fit&nbsp;
in the waterproof bag I kept on top of my rear seat with bungees.&nbsp;
I kept clothes to a bare minimum. Took two pairs of jeans, one pair shorts,
a bathing suit, half a dozen T shirts, one fleece sweater, and my touring
boots. No extra shoes or sandals as&nbsp; luggage space was pretty limited.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#CC6600">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Carried all my camera gear in a small Pelican 1200 waterproof case inside
the hard saddlebag, a&nbsp;</font><font color="#66FFFF"> Pentax MX</font><font color="#CC6600">
body with 4 lenses,&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF9900">28mm, 40mm, 50mm,
135mm</font><font color="#CC6600">. I like the MX because it is the smallest
35mm camera Pentax ever made, and is totally mechanical, if the battery
dies you still have all your shutter speeds.&nbsp; Shot mostly negatives
and a few slides.</font></font></font>

July 21st 1998.&nbsp;</font><font color="#CC6600"> My family was overseas
visiting relatives , and I had just finished working as a focus puller
on a TV movie here.&nbsp; It was good timing for a trip, and I had one
month to do it. My last trip had been after the Titanic film here two years
ago. (As key rigging grip I got to hang a 20 ton Russian deep dive sub
in the studio). James Cameron made us all somewhat richer, so I went rafting
through the Grand Canyon for a week. This time though, I was ready for
a good long distance two wheel flog. I left </font><font color="#FF0000">Halifax</font><font color="#CC6600">
with </font><font color="#FFCCCC">16,400 kms</font><font color="#CC6600">
showing on the odometer. Went direct to Moncton, then north up backroads&nbsp;
thru Rogersville to Miramichi river and over to Grand Falls , 28 degrees
C here.&nbsp; Made it north to </font><font color="#CC66CC">Riviere du
Loup</font><font color="#CC6600"> by late afternoon and took the ferry
to </font><font color="#009900">St. Simeon</font><font color="#CC6600">
on the north shore of the </font><font color="#3366FF">St. Lawrence River</font><font color="#CC6600">.
This is a nice boat ride, about one hr and approx $ 30.&nbsp; There were
a few bikes onboard, one Harley was towing a trailer made from a big wooden
beer barrel with a tap on the back. The top was cutoff and a dog had his
bed inside.&nbsp; Drove up the west side of the Saguenay River to </font><font color="#FF6666">Robertval</font><font color="#CC6600">
about 10pm and tented. Managed to do about </font><font color="#FF0000">1100
kms</font><font color="#CC6600"> for the day.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#33FF33">Day 2
:</font><font color="#3366FF">&nbsp;</font><font color="#CC6600"> I’d always
wanted to drive the road to&nbsp; </font><font color="#FFCC00">Chibougamau&nbsp;</font><font color="#CC6600">
over to northern Ontario. It is 200 kms shorter to Thunder Bay (from Riv
du Loup) than the Trans Canada and had some other great advantages I soon
found out.&nbsp; Imagine a 600 km road (from </font><font color="#FF99FF">Lac
St Jean to Senneterre</font><font color="#CC6600">) with great scenery
( ahh . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yes . . .&nbsp; and a lot of trees too),&nbsp;
long straights, gentle curves, almost no trucks, no tourists, and for a
real bonus . . . </font><font color="#33FF33">no police</font><font color="#CC6600">.
There’s a station in Chibougamau, but that’s 20kms off a T junction down
a dead end.&nbsp; Well, if you want a trip to long distance speed nirvana
, this pretty well qualifies, short of driving to Montana or Nevada. I
ran between 120 and 150 kph for most of it.&nbsp; Lowest temps were 14
degrees in sun , got better as I hooked south again. From Senneterre I
went west on paved backroads to </font><font color="#999900">Cochrane</font><font color="#CC6600">
( still no traffic to speak of ) and hit thunderstorms and heavy squalls
after supper. Put on my rainsuit and rain boots. Took a cheap motel in
</font><font color="#33CCFF">Kapuskasing</font><font color="#CC6600">
for $ 25.&nbsp; About 1200 kms total for the day.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#33FF33">Day 3
:&nbsp;</font><font color="#CC6600"> Hit&nbsp; rain and dirt construction
sections, miserable day. Picked up a stone in my throttle pulley V groove,
noticed lumpy running below 2500 rpm. The local BMW mechanic Ed, found
my first one last year, so I looked again and there it was, got it out
with a toothbrush. Voila, smooth again. Feeling happy with myself I charged
off into the “ughknown”&nbsp; and managed to run out of gas in the butt
end of nowhere. I had added 3 liters to the tank capacity ( total now is
26 liters ) with an RT filler neck before I left and was obviously feeling
too cocky.&nbsp; As my Kansas City friend used to say,&nbsp; I was now
</font><font color="#99FF99">a
victim of the six P’s :</font></font></font>

Standing in the rain,</font><font color="#CC6600">&nbsp; I held my one
liter oil can over the tank upside down while&nbsp; pointing to it as people
drove by ( not many people going by either out here). A fellow biker driving
a pickup truck stopped and took me to a fishing guide 6 miles away who
had a gas pump and a beat up Harley, everyone else within 30 miles had
two stroke mixed for the next chainsaw derby or whatever. I only lost about
90 minutes and </font><font color="#FF0000">swore that would be the last
time…</font><font color="#CC6600">. and it was. Made it to </font><font color="#CC66CC">Thunder
Bay</font><font color="#CC6600"> as the weather kept improving, then had
a great ride to </font><font color="#FF6666">Dryden</font><font color="#CC6600">
through the woods on a twisty but good road in the evening and late twilight.
Splurged on another cheap hotel, $ 50, and hoped it would be my last. (

ass prairie’&nbsp; to </font><font color="#FF0000">Moose Jaw</font><font color="#CC6600">
for a night tenting. $ 6, a new low !&nbsp;&nbsp; Park beside two his and
hers Harley Davidsons from BC, one towing a trailer.&nbsp; My four day
target to reach Calgary is not going to happen. Needed another 2 hours
a day in the saddle to do that. Still happy with the pace so far,&nbsp;
1000 kms today.</font></font></font>

Calgary</font><font color="#CC6600">, things starting to get really hot
at </font><font color="#FF6666">Swift Current</font><font color="#CC6600">,
35.4 deg C. Funny how you feel better when that readout drops even two
tenths of a degree. Open my boot flaps down to catch more wind, soak the
T shirt in water, let it hang out at the waist and leave the leather jacket
on half open to grab more evaporation. This lasts at least 2 hours if you
control the jacket intake, your armpits and back stay cool and wet for
a long time. I learned this from travelling in </font><font color="#FFCC00">Australia</font><font color="#CC6600">
years ago riding in a car all day at 42 deg C on dirt roads…. (&nbsp; sounds
pretty ugly doesn’t it ?)&nbsp; Leave your shirt off, put a dripping wet
towel around your neck and spread it across your chest, turn the vent windows
in and suddenly you’re “ a bloody big canvas water bag, mate “, getting
all that free evaporation effect. Worked for me this time too. Made it
to Calgary by 3pm, noticed the temperature dropped 5 degrees an hour east
of Calgary, must be the cooler air coming off the mountains, was a big
relief. Stayed with Dave, an old skydiving friend from Halifax.</font></font></font>

:</font><font color="#CC6600"> Sunday.&nbsp; Visited relatives and planned
my next move, now that I had successfully made it this far. Most people
back home thought this was my final destination. My philosophy is : </font><font color="#FFCCFF">why

tire, big store selling all brands plus beemers. Great guys, fast service…
out before noon. The Bridgestone BT 54 was shot and I put on a Dunlop sportmax
touring 205, ( I notice they are on the new R1100S ) , the only decent
tire (at a price I was up for) that they stocked in 18 inch. I figured
it was a sacrificial tire anyway, if it did what I wanted and got me home
it wouldn’t owe me anything. Threw in a new air filter and hit the road
for…..&nbsp; where else…. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Sparwood BC </font><font color="#CC6600">,
home of the world’s largest dumptruck. Went down hwy 22, one of the prettiest
in Alberta, to the </font><font color="#66FF99">Crowsnest Pass</font><font color="#CC6600">,

worth the detour. Backtracked to Coleman and turned north on the dirt forest
service roads towards Banff. Did 100 kms of gravel road, very well maintained

another half hour of&nbsp; pavement to </font><font color="#33CCFF">Canmore</font><font color="#CC6600">.

Springs Hotel</font><font color="#CC6600"> where I worked as an electrician
in 1970. Used to have pass keys for every place in that building, and now
I gagged at the huge growth it had gone through. Did Lake Louise going
north (more crowds, seen it in better days thank you) and headed for Columbia
icefields. Spent the night wild camping outside </font><font color="#CC66CC">Jasper</font><font color="#CC6600">.
Listened to huge coal and freight trains screaming past on the main CN

an hour before the Alaska ferry left. Met Ed and Bill. Ed was from Red
Deer, Alberta, pulling a trailer with a Yamaha Venture, Bill (not his real
name) had long hair and was riding a Goldwing to Alaska from California.&nbsp;
Ed asked me where I was going, told him I didn’t know, either Haines or
Skagway , the last two stops on the ferry trip. Ed said he had planned
to go south to Bellingham, Washington, but there were no tickets left on
that boat , so he&nbsp; said ‘ What the hell, I’ll go to Alaska instead
.’</font></font></font>

? ... why not ! '</font></b><b></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#CC6600">We had
a good trip, 36 hours for about $220 US. Stopped in half a dozen ports
including </font><font color="#33CCFF">Juneau</font><font color="#CC6600">
the capitol (imagine Ottawa with no roads in or out…. can you spell airline
profit ?)</font></font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#CC6600"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After a day of camping out on the deckchairs with Bill and lots of other
tourists from all over the globe, I realized I didn’t know what he did
for a living. I figured him for a diesel mechanic, or construction worker
maybe. So I asked him.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#CC6600">He paused
for a moment and then said </font><font color="#FFCC33">“ . . . . well
Tree . . . ,&nbsp; I’m a state trooper.”</font><font color="#FF6600">&nbsp;</font><font color="#CC6600">
I just started to laugh,&nbsp; he had such a perfect cover.</font><font color="#999900">
“ Oh ya,” he said, “ you wouldn’t believe the guys who come up to me and
try to sell me dope on the street. . . . ”</font><font color="#CC6600">&nbsp;
I asked him if he ever drove highway patrol, he had for the first few years
.&nbsp; He was a funny guy, had some good stories. Told me about running
into some Hells Angels outside a bar once as he got on his bike, worried
they would recognize him under his helmet and shades. Just as he’s backing
out one guy yells at him “ Hey, hey” and runs over. Gets all his buddies&nbsp;
around and points down at Bill’s bike, “would ya looka dat,&nbsp; holy
sh i i i t, his bike’s got reeee-verse ! ”&nbsp; They all stand around
and marvel , one guy says… “what’ll those #@**# Japs think of next ! “.&nbsp;
A week later, Bill’s out on the freeway when a chopper roars up beside
him but doesn’t go by and the guy is waving and hollering at Bill. Oh no,
here we go again, Bill’s&nbsp; thinking. Guy yells&nbsp; “Reee-verse !!!”&nbsp;&nbsp;
pointing at the gas tank and waving. Reminds me of a famous quote about
Alaska . . . . . . </font><font color="#009900">“ Girls, if you want to
get married, go to Alaska.&nbsp; The odds are good . . . . but the goods
are odd. ”</font></font></font>

:&nbsp;</font><font color="#CC6600"> All day on the boat.&nbsp; Nice ferry
ride up thru inland passage to Skagway. Stopped at various ports including
Juneau. Ed and I took a taxi into town for some new cigars for him, and
stopped to look at the glacier that sits north of the city. I notice that
the bikers don't wear helmets in general, but their passengers do, must
be a town or state bylaw.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#33FF33">Day 12

at </font><font color="#33CCFF">Haines</font><font color="#CC6600"> about
2am heading north via Haines Junction to Alaska. This route is very pretty,
and is about 100 miles shorter than Skagway through Whitehorse to Haines
Jct. ( The Skagway route is no slouch for scenery either. ) We dock at

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#CC6600">Glen
and his wife are on another Goldwing from Minnesota pulling a trailer.
Ed and I follow him out through the deserted town. We climb steeply up
the White Pass trail into the morning fog. It is 20 miles to the Canadian
border. For a while we are up in the clouds then down to a very desolate
border crossing. Brrr. No hassles . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; do I have any guns,
booze, bad habits etc. We have coffee at </font><font color="#FF0000">Carcross</font><font color="#CC6600">
(caribou crossing) where 30,000 homemade boats came down the lake in the
Klondike goldrush of 1898, then on to </font><font color="#FFFFFF">Whitehorse</font><font color="#CC6600">
( 200 km from Skagway ) for breakfast. Glen heads north, Ed heads south
down Alaska hwy to Dawson Creek and back to Red Deer. I go to look for
an oil change. My bike had used less oil than I expected on a long trip,
half a liter in 7500 kms . Stop at the Yamaha dealer and browse, see heated
vests for $ 99 , the same one was $ 120 in Hfx ….&nbsp; What’s a guy to
do !&nbsp; Sold.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#CC6600">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Go to Crappy Tire and get some more 20/50 Castrol (my last GTX… switched
to Motul synthetic later in trip), then back to the dealer who cheerfully
loans me a drop tray for my 4 liters of very black stuff. Yes, I agree
7500 kms is a bit excessive, but they were all highway miles weren’t they
your honour. Install my spare </font><font color="#FFCC00">oil filter</font><font color="#CC6600">,
throw in a new pair of&nbsp; </font><font color="#66FF99">spark plugs</font><font color="#CC6600">

of town. Paul has been there for 25 yrs, living in a nice three story 20
x 20 ft house with no plumbing. His livingroom has the biggest collection
of car and bike books I have seen in years. Neat house. Kitchen is the
first floor, livingroom the second, and bedroom loft is on the top. His
buddy who lives 10 miles further away and has no phone service, installed
an antenna on Paul’s roof and has a repeater on a mountain somewhere else.
Box of electronics in Paul’s kitchen switches calls into </font><font color="#FFFF00">Yukon</font><font color="#CC6600">

just under my eyes. Put it in my pocket for a souvenir. Stop at the Yukon
Baha ’ i Institute which is on this road and meet some fellow Baha’is from
Africa and Ottawa. Very nice wooden building with high ceiling in a six
sided circle shape. Continue north through some newly burned forest fires,
patches of ground still smoking. Very dry season, fires for last two months
in this area. Get about halfway to Dawson, tent in Minto by the Yukon river
at 10pm. Cold water running&nbsp; fast, you can hear the current as it
breaks around the rocks by the shore. Stays light enough to see until about
1am in my tent.&nbsp; 300 kms today.&nbsp; Campground $ 10</font></font></font>

It will take about 3 hours&nbsp; he adds.&nbsp; So, you leave Top of the

Lots of people stopping to check it out, only man made diversion for fifty

would allow up to 100 to 110 kph. Came down&nbsp; mile after winding&nbsp;

Back on pavement. This stretch was probably the highlight of my trip, don’t

who downed 40 planes during the Pacific campaign.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
his P 38 Lightning was no longer outside on a tall pedestal, but off in
storage waiting for his bigger museum in Superior. Drove another hour and
tented at a state park up in the hills above </font><font color="#FFCC99">Lake
Superior</font><font color="#CC6600">.&nbsp; 900 kms today.</font></font></font>

:&nbsp;</font><font color="#CC6600"> Finished driving the south shore of
Lake Superior today. By 3pm it was 30 degrees so I stopped at a very long
beach and had a swim in the clear water. Lots of people sunbathing, it
was a scorcher. Got to&nbsp; </font><font color="#33CCFF">Sault St. Marie</font><font color="#CC6600">
by supper, looked into the Canadian Bush Pilot museum on the waterfront.
Got halfway to Sudbury by 11pm, tented at a campground past </font><font color="#FF0000">Blind
River</font><font color="#CC6600">. $10&nbsp;&nbsp; 800 kms today</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#33FF33">Day 28
:&nbsp;</font><font color="#CC6600"> Woke up to&nbsp; rain clouds, got
my tent stowed just before a downpour. Hid out in the shower building for
twenty minutes until I could pack the bike. Headed to </font><font color="#FF99FF">Sudbury</font><font color="#CC6600">
in showers.&nbsp; Had lunch in North Bay, got to </font><font color="#FFFF00">Ottawa</font><font color="#CC6600">
about supper. A real bed at another friend’s house for a change.</font></font></font>

kms , pretty easy day.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#33FF33">Day 29
:</font><font color="#CC6600">&nbsp; Overcast, no rain, southeast towards
Montreal,&nbsp; then turn off south to Cornwall area so I could cross the
St Lawrence west of the big city and stay on secondary roads.&nbsp; Nice
countryside to </font><font color="#CC33CC">Cowansville</font><font color="#CC6600">
area. Stopped at a Yamaha shop in Bedford, a small town . Met Pascal, a
racer who owned the store. Very nice guy to deal with, took the bike into
the shop after hours and we installed a new front Battlax tire for a lot
less than I would pay back home. This was a good time to do it, there was
already 22,000 kms on the old one, my longest tire yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
overdue for an oil change , dug out my spare filter and made the leap to
synthetic oil, Motul 3100 4T. Pascal&nbsp; uses it in his race and street
bikes, and sells hundreds of liters to his customers and racers.&nbsp;
There was 10,000 kms on the old oil in 24 days, I was definitely pushing
my luck. Rode down into Vermont and New Hampshire late, dodge 2 moose and
a fox, too close for comfort on the big guys. Entered </font><font color="#66FFFF">Dix
Notch state park</font><font color="#CC6600">, no campgrounds. Went up
a dirt road to tent about 1am.&nbsp; 500 kms today, feel like a tourist
for a change, lazy pace.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#33FF33">Day 30
:&nbsp; Aug 19th.&nbsp; </font><font color="#CC6600">Last day on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Up at 7am, park ranger in a 4wd showed up about twenty minutes later when
I’m half packed. Nice guy, mid thirties, just laughs and says.. “Well I
guess you’ve done a bit of this before if you went to Alaska and back”.
We yarn a while about smugglers and his job. He is from Ashland&nbsp; Wisc,
which I came through two days earlier.&nbsp; Talk for half an hour, then
down hwy 26 to Rumford and east on hwy 2 towards Bangor, heading for the
ferry out of </font><font color="#FF0000">Bar Harbour, Maine.</font><font color="#CC6600">&nbsp;
Meet an interesting couple in the ferry parking lot,&nbsp; driving a Honda
Goldwing 1500 trike pulling a trailer.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF99">Jack
and Zoe Cox </font><font color="#33FF33">are from Oklahoma</font><font color="#CC6600">
and have been married 55 years, Dick flew </font><font color="#FF0000">B25’s
and P38’s</font><font color="#CC6600"> during the war.&nbsp; His wife says
they got the 2 wheeler converted to a trike&nbsp; last&nbsp; year. Dick
tells me he did it partly because she was having trouble keeping the 2
wheeler up by herself when she drove ( 800 lbs ! ) . Now&nbsp; Zoe drives&nbsp;
whenever Jack wants a rest, she says it's as easy as a car. They had already
done the Cabot Trail in&nbsp; Cape Breton a few years ago on two wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was great to meet two people who still liked to bike, no matter what
age.&nbsp; As a Florida BMW rider in her seventies said to a friend of
mine once, </font><font color="#3366FF">“ If it hurts as much to stay home
as it does being on the road, you may as well be on the road . “</font></font></font>

Boarded the ferry about 4pm, the new FastCat turbine powered catamaran
from </font><font color="#009900">Tasmania</font><font color="#CC6600">,
fastest ferry in North America.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#CC6600"><font size=+1>It runs
on 2 hulls at 90 kph,&nbsp; has four 9500 hp jet turbine engines running&nbsp;
waterjet nozzles like an overpowered seadoo.&nbsp; Great trip, very calm
seas. Room for 200 cars, it is 300 ft long.&nbsp; I park my bike away from
the cars and strap it down in 4 directions in case the water gets rough.&nbsp;
At these speeds it wouldn’t take much swell to really bounce around.</font></font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#CC6600">We do
the six hour trip in two and a half hours.&nbsp; Get off in </font><font color="#3366FF">Yarmouth</font><font color="#CC6600">
at 8pm and head straight for home, a three hour run. It is only the second
time on this trip I have done any serious night riding , there were too
many animals up north to make it worthwhile, and you don’t see much scenery
running at night.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#33FF33">As I
pull into</font><font color="#CC6600"> my driveway the odometer is turning
</font><font color="#FFFF99">35,400
kms</font><font color="#CC6600">. Not bad for 28 days,&nbsp; 19,000 kms
or an average of about 700 kms per day. ( about 12,000 miles ) I crossed
the border ten times between the States and Canada, and never spent more
than a couple of minutes doing it. Only had four nights in hotels, five
with friends, two on the ferry, and eighteen tenting. Spent about $ 500
on gas, $ 500 on ferries and $ 300 on hotels. It has been a great trip,&nbsp;
the memories will stay with me for a long time.&nbsp; Some of the best
people you meet on bikes are on the longer trips, they have the same kind
of road fever for the long haul and new sights every day.&nbsp; It is a
great way to see any country.&nbsp; It has been over thirty years since
I started riding motorcycles, and&nbsp; now I have finally taken one to
the Yukon and Alaska. If you have the time to do it, I can't think of a
better place to go. </font><font color="#CC66CC">Maybe I’ll even try for
Inuvik and Prudhoe Bay next time !</font></font></font>

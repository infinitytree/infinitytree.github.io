the road again. Over <font color="#FF6600">Baralach La ….</font> hmmmm,
this looks familiar. For miles there are <font color="#FF0000">lone army
sentries with rifles</font> standing by the road, sometimes every 500 ft.&nbsp;
We wave, they smile or nod their heads…… crazy tourists on bikes.&nbsp;
Down into the valley through the streams and fast water again. I like the

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
the border to <font color="#FF0000">Ladakh </font>we get off the bikes
while Peter takes in our passports. A large dumptruck is just ahead of
us, the driver’s door open. A woman passenger is in the front seat alone.
<font color="#66FFFF">Martin</font>
yells and I turn around to see the truck has started to roll very slowly
back down the hill towards us.&nbsp; I run ahead&nbsp; and grab a <font color="#FFCCFF">brick-sized
rock</font> off the shoulder as I go, jamming it under the rear wheel.&nbsp;
It does the job and the truck stops, only moving ten or fifteen feet. It&nbsp;
happened so fast I didn’t think about it, I just moved.&nbsp; I get a thumbs
up from the crew.&nbsp; This is why there are always <font color="#33FF33">2
drivers in India, </font><font color="#66FFFF">one&nbsp; puts the rocks
against the rear wheel before the other gets out. </font>We will dodge
many of these rocks <font color="#FF0000">left in the middle of the road
on steep hills .</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are cleared
by the army to enter Ladakh. We leave <font color="#33FF33">Himachal Pradesh</font>,
and head down a valley following the river. Ahead is our <font color="#FF0000">first
5,000 meter pass, Lachlung La.</font>&nbsp; The day is still sunny. The
climb up is challenging gravel and dirt but not too severe and we celebrate
at the top with more photos. The air feels thinner, but no one seems to
be complaining. Our last few days chasing up and down have acclimatized
us.</font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>On our way down into <font color="#FF99FF">Pang</font>
we travel through deep gorges with long sand dunes cascading down from
the mountains. I take a photo of Peter with his front wheel parked on the
edge. It is an interesting change from the sheer rock we have seen everywhere.
I can imagine oceans here millions of years ago before it was thrust up.
The <font color="#66FFFF">Himalayas</font> are very young compared to other

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Pang
we cross a bridge with army guards and pull into the <font color="#66FF99">Tibetan
tent city</font> for a late lunch. It has been a long day, only 160 kms
but many&nbsp; hours of hard riding. We will camp down by the river outside
town. This will be a record for me, <font color="#FF6666">tenting at&nbsp;
15,600 ft.&nbsp;</font> The moon and stars are more brilliant than I have

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 7
am and I am standing outside my tent in Pang looking up the mountain road
that <font color="#FFCCCC">snakes a thousand feet above us</font>. All
the loaded fuel trucks have been let loose after the night embargo and
they are attacking the hill en mass&nbsp; heading north. There are dozens
of them belching black diesel as they move left and right along the multiple
hairpins, passing each other wherever they can. It is an awesome vision
of&nbsp; <font color="#66FF99">grinding gears, belching black exhaust smoke,

<p><img SRC="mooreplains.jpg" height=291 width=449>
<p><b>More plains</b></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later we
climb up the same route and come to an amazing change in terrain. We are
on the <font color="#FF0000">More Plains</font>,&nbsp; a 50 km stretch
of flat tablelands with green grass to the horizon and&nbsp; mountains
on both sides. It is my idea of what the Mongolian steppes must look like.
There are goat and yak herds scattered across the landscape, it looks like
paradise after the desolate Pang.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My speedo
seems to have quit , I find the cable has wrapped around the front axle
when the housing came loose. By the time Martin stops to help I have it
disconnected and tied up to the handle bars with some plastic cable ties
I carry…… on we go.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we are
heading up 20 kms of unpaved, rough and corrugated gravel and dirt to <font color="#CCFFFF">Tanglang
La </font>pass. There is a <font color="#FF0000">truck on its side over
the edge</font> at one place, having slid down the flat slope about 100
feet.&nbsp; Luckily the wheels are down the hill, and long poles have been
wedged in below it to stop it from sliding more. It is another <font color="#33FF33">1500
ft down to the river……&nbsp; </font>that driver must have said the right
prayers. That explains the two old wrecker trucks we have been passing
for the last few days.</font></font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="clifftruck.jpg" height=566 width=834></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The road
is so rough now that I prefer to ride standing up on the pegs.&nbsp; I
can go&nbsp; faster, and the bumps smooth out. We stop for a work crew
halfway up. We cannot pass , the road is too narrow. There are forty or
fifty kids and younger people crowded around their morning taxi, a dump
truck. The door is open , and an argument seems to be going on with someone
inside. <font color="#66FF99">Two men climb up into the cab</font> and
start laying into the driver. They get out… more arguing. We shut down
the bikes and watch. Back in they go, more fists and out they get. The
problem must be solved, because the driver starts up and moves on past
us. The crew wave as we go by. All the road crews we pass on this trip
seem to be very&nbsp; friendly……&nbsp; glad I don’t drive their truck though.</font></font>

<p><b>Typical road repairs......&nbsp; tar fires.</b></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We finally
reach the top of Tanglang La, pass, <font color="#33FF33">the second highest
motor able road in the world</font> at </font><font color="#FFCCFF">5,360
meters (17,580 ft). </font><font size=+1>It is overcast,&nbsp; grey, desolate
and cold, not a place that makes you want to hang around long. There is
a marker with the usual <font color="#FF6600">Tibetan prayer flags</font>
fluttering, and a stone building with snow on the slopes behind. We get
some pictures and quickly head down the other side.&nbsp; Brrrrr.&nbsp;
We have now crossed the <font color="#66FFFF">Zanskar mountain range.</font></font></font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="tanglangla.jpg" height=246 width=428></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
40 kms and 2000 meters down through river canyons and we come to the <font color="#33FF33">Indus
River</font> at <font color="#FF6600">Upshi</font>. This is a famous river
that flows northwest into <font color="#66FFFF">Pakistan</font> then south
to the <font color="#3366FF">Indian ocean</font> near <font color="#FF0000">Karachi.</font>
We have covered 125 kms since Pang. There are trees and greenbelts along
this valley, compared to the mountains it is an oasis . We stop for food
and I take a photo of a holy man across the street near a prayer wheel.</font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we are
cruising along the flatlands at 3,300 meters on pavement towards<font color="#33FF33">
Leh,</font> the capital. There are many villages and some impressive monasteries.
<font color="#33CCFF">Thikse</font>
is one of the best known . We see large Indian army garrisons along the
way, this is a large base for the on again / off again border wars with
Pakistan farther up the valley near <font color="#FF0000">Kargil</font>.&nbsp;
We arrive in the town of Leh and head to our hotel. <font color="#FFCCCC">Hotel
La Ri Mo</font> is a two story u shaped building with a nice courtyard
for parking the bikes.&nbsp; We sit in the garden at a table under a tree
and the waiter brings us beer and for me, mango juice.&nbsp; We are 185

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Today we will relax, mostly just walk around this historic town. Leh&nbsp;
was a meeting place for caravans on the trade route from <font color="#FFCCCC">Tibet
and central Asia</font>. They&nbsp; came via the <font color="#66FF99">Karakoram
Pass at 5570m</font> on their way to the <font color="#33FF33">Kashmir
valley.</font> The crumbling 16th century Royal Palace dominates the town,
it has many stories and sits high on <font color="#FFCCCC">Tesemo Hill</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The atmosphere seems very friendly, even though there are many Indian soldiers
with rifles on the main street as the night curfew is still in effect.
The easy going Tibetan markets are a sharp contrast to the hard nosed <font color="#FF0000">Kashmiri</font>
merchants competing for your rupees as you pass their shops. I try to buy
from the Tibetans , they have beautiful smiles and always seem to be genuinely
happy to see you, and never upset if you don’t buy. Many of these people&nbsp;
or their parents have walked across the mountains from <font color="#66FF99">Chinese
controlled Tibet</font>.&nbsp; I’m sure it is a harder trip than I will
ever make.</font></font>

<b>Golf course in the sand bowl at Leh</b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pick up
some silver jewelry as presents and pay 18 rupees per gram, the going rate.
They pull out small calculator sized electronic scales to weigh it. In
one bazaar I see a bracelet with gold inlay that I like, and pick it up.
The lady asks me what I want to pay for it…….&nbsp; I tell her that I am
really just looking, but she still wants me to give her a price. I know
what they cost in Delhi, but here they are half that.&nbsp; I tell her
what I would pay ………. if I wanted it. <font color="#FFCCFF">She rolls her
eyes and laughs kindly</font>, shaking her head. I like this woman, she
has a good aura. Her price is between mine and the Delhi price. I say thanks
but it’s too much for me, and walk&nbsp; to the next table. A few minutes
later she comes over, worried I will buy something from one of her friends
instead.&nbsp; She says I can have it if I pay only <font color="#33FF33">50
rupees more.</font> Done. She looks at me again and laughs, knowing I have
gotten a bargain ( at least I think so…....&nbsp; ).&nbsp; Later on the
trip I meet another merchant&nbsp; who asks me what I paid for my bracelet.
When I tell her , she shakes her head and says that this is not possible,&nbsp;
and refuses to believe me.&nbsp; Must have been my lucky day.</font></font>

<p><img SRC="lehstupa.jpg" height=400 width=244></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
walk up the hill and&nbsp; visit the Buddhist temple called <font color="#33FF33">Shanti
Stupa</font> overlooking the town. The <font color="#FF0000">Dalai Lama
</font>was
instrumental with it’s construction which is fairly new. There are ( I
think) six hundreds steps up , it has a commanding view of the valley.&nbsp;
Below us is a military parade ground with polo players charging back and
forth. I walk down later and get a photo of them charging across the landscape.
Off in the distance you can see a desert bowl between two hills. It looks
hot and barren, just rocks and sand. There are small dots wandering across
it, someone tells me it is the local golf course !</font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At night
we eat in a restaurant up the street from our hotel. When we leave at 11
the power has been off for hours. Most shopkeepers run small generators
on the sidewalk during the day, as the electricity often goes off without
warning here. The streets are dark and a curfew is still in effect. <font color="#66FFFF">Only
the army, police…… and tourists are allowed to wander freely.</font> We
have the town to ourselves, a strange feeling. For sure this is the only
time I will ever see empty streets in India.&nbsp; When we get home the
hotel front office is locked up, all the staff have hurried&nbsp; home
at 10pm before they are trapped at work. <font color="#FF0000">Henning
</font>and
I can’t get our key, so we crawl in the tiny bathroom window. There are
candles in the room, and Uwe will unlock us in the morning….. we hope.

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
the day we have all come here for. Last night we met another Peter ( and
his wife ) from England. They have driven all the way from <font color="#FF6666">southern
India</font> in a <font color="#66FFFF">new autorickshaw</font> they bought
for 1000 pounds. They plan to take it all the way to <font color="#FF0000">Khardung
La</font>. Peter keeps us laughing with his stories of riding on the edge
of eternity with all their luggage and a 125cc motor. I can’t imagine the
beating they took to get here over passes like Tanglang La. They are young
and keen, I have no doubt they will make it. ( and they do ).&nbsp; Only
the Brits are crazy enough&nbsp; to take a rickshaw !</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Footnote:&nbsp; I told a Colorado
friend Dan Bailey about our tour and he went to India the next summer on
a mountain bike towing a one wheel trailer. Two of them went all the way

Manali !</font></font>

<p><b>Passing yaks on the way</b></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We head
out of Leh 3,506m under blue skies. It is only 12 kms as the crow flies
from Leh to the top of <font color="#33FF33">Khardung La pass at 5,603
m</font>, but we will have to climb 2,000 meters to get there.&nbsp; Up
the dirt road we go, until we clear the army post that controls the approach
to the pass. Peter has&nbsp; permits from Leh, we pass without problem.
As we ride higher we have a great view of the <font color="#FFCCCC">Indus
river valley</font> and the <font color="#66FFFF">Zanskar mountains </font>behind
to the south. We are getting closer to the <font color="#FF0000">Karakoram
mountains</font> than the Himalayas now.&nbsp; It is a long climb with
little traffic. An army jeep with 4 people passes us when we stop. Later
we see them by the road having a break. There is the driver with an older
officer and two ladies, probably a sight seeing trip for his family.&nbsp;
The war has cooled down since last year, although there will always be
thousands of soldiers stationed around Leh. Not far away on the 22,000
foot high <font color="#33FF33">Siachen Glacier,</font> Pakistan and India
still lob artillery shells at each other.&nbsp; It is the highest battlefield
in history, most fatalities are from medical complications like <font color="#FF0000">pulmonary
edema</font> than guns.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>The road is a mixture of dirt
and gravel, towards the top it gets rougher.&nbsp; Before we know it we
are there.&nbsp; <font color="#33FF33">We are now at 18,300 ft above sea
level</font>.&nbsp; We all look at each other, slowly realizing that we
have actually made it. Lots of picture taking and back slapping.</font></font>

<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk
to the north side and gaze farther down the road into the <font color="#FFCCCC">Nubra
Valley</font>. Until 1992 it was off limits. <font color="#99FF99">Uwe</font>
calls me over and points to the northwest. He tells us that he has heard
that you can see<font color="#66FFFF"> K2 </font>from here, second highest
peak in the world. We scan the mountains on the horizon, and there it is
<font color="#FF0000">100
kms away in Pakistan</font>. I put my longest lens, the 135mm, on my camera
so we can all see it larger.&nbsp; It is majestic, sticking up through
the clouds.&nbsp; I need a much stronger lens to get a good photo though.
It is still sunny but cold. Not much else up here but an army post, radio
antennas and some bulldozers in various states of repair.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can all
feel the <font color="#33FF33">altitude sapping our breath</font>, so after
about 30 minutes we are ready to descend.&nbsp; On the way down we stop
for a <font color="#FFCCFF">herd of yaks</font> blocking the way. By the
time we get to Leh it feels like we have&nbsp; accomplished something not
quite believable…….&nbsp; but it does feel good.&nbsp; This road has been
summited by countless people and machines……..&nbsp; <font color="#99FF99">bicycles,
rickshaws, even inline roller skates </font>we heard ( two crazy Italians
). It is not a hard feat for a motorcycle, I would probably rate Tanglang
La as a tougher pass and more desolate in the weather I rode it returning
south. But <font color="#FF0000">Khardung La</font> is unique, you cannot
drive on a higher public road anywhere else on the planet.&nbsp; <font color="#CCFFFF">Everest</font>
costs about $70,000 for a well heeled tourist climber, so this is the poor
man’s answer to driving the equivalent and getting back alive.</font></font>

3 days acclimatizing (very important…….&nbsp; see note below ) and rent
a <font color="#FF0000">Bullet </font>locally if you had limited time.
Pay for the permit to drive to Khardung La ….. and go do it !&nbsp; I saw
bikes for rent in Leh, and I am assuming they can go anywhere locally like
the <font color="#66FFFF">Nubra Valley</font> if you have the right permits.
What you would miss is an amazing road trip from the lowlands of New Delhi,

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were

back that had gone almost nonstop to Leh in a couple of days. The driver
was not mountain experienced, and after taking 40 odd people up to <font color="#66FFFF">Khardung
La</font> the next day, ( that is an <font color="#33FF33">18,000 ft altitude

one cook is over in the corner with a traditional tandoori oven. He is

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#CCFFFF">1972</font>……
it is 4am in <font color="#FF0000">Bombay</font>.&nbsp; Flying from <font color="#FF99FF">Singapore
to London</font>, my plane has stopped here to refuel. As I walk across
the tarmac to the terminal building, the smells of <font color="#FF6600">India</font>
waft across the hot night air. It is a strange and exotic place to me ,&nbsp;
more like landing on another planet.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>Two years later, I fly east
again towards <font color="#66FFFF">Australia</font>. We leave <font color="#00CC00">Bahrain</font>
and for three cloudless hours I watch the&nbsp; Indian subcontinent glide
by underneath. We start over a <font color="#CC6600">brown and dry Pakistan</font>
and as we cross India the country gradually changes colour, until it is
a <font color="#33FF33">bright emerald green</font>&nbsp; when we leave
it behind over&nbsp; the <font color="#FFCC33">Bay of Bengal</font>.&nbsp;
Looking down I think, maybe someday&nbsp; I will get to spend more than
just one hour in <font color="#33CCFF">India.</font></font></font>

<p><br>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a
good flight over,&nbsp; sit next to a <font color="#FF0000">Russian </font>fellow
who sells Lada cars in <font color="#33FF33">Montreal</font>. Only Quebecers
will buy them it seems. We have two big seats up in the nose of the 747,
china&nbsp; plates and a real menu…… nice change from Scare Canada. We
land in Frankfurt at 10am in a lightning storm and pelting rain. I only
have to wait a few hours before the next jumbo takes me east. We leave
again at 2 pm, now I am back in tourist class, crammed in, but at least
I have a nice window seat. Only eight hours to go. The fifty-ish Indian
couple next to me are heading back to <font color="#66FFFF">Delhi </font>from
the USA. He is a professor in <font color="#FFCC99">Chicago</font>, she
tells me that the heat in Delhi is hard on her, she has been away for twenty
years now.&nbsp; Hungary goes by underneath us somewhere. Later when the
clouds clear we are over the <font color="#C0C0C0">Black Sea</font>, the&nbsp;
water&nbsp; stretches to the horizon, endless. Around dusk the <font color="#CC6600">Caspian
Sea </font>slides past, soon we will be over <font color="#FFCCFF">Kabul</font>
and then down into the Indian subcontinent.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we land
in <font color="#FFCC33">New Delhi</font> it is after midnight.&nbsp; I
walk into a modern&nbsp; new arrivals hall and get my baggage. There are
no hassles at customs, they check my 6 month India tourist visa, look at
me once,&nbsp; and give it the rubber stamp.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think ' Can
it be this easy ? ' …….. apparently yes.&nbsp; I change $ 200 US into rupees
( about nine thousand ) and look for my contact, a <font color="#00CC00">Sikh</font>
taxi driver. He is easy to spot, his Sikh turban is one of only a few in
this crowd. He has a sign with&nbsp; “Tree” written in big letters. I follow
him out to an old diesel <font color="#FFCCCC">Austin Ambassador</font>&nbsp;
like&nbsp; many other taxis in India, the most popular brand. He works
for the hotel I will be staying at in the centre of town, and Peter has
told me he is very reliable. There are wild stories about taxis in <font color="#FF0000">New
Delhi</font>…….&nbsp; Peter knows many and has strongly advised me to use
his man for the airport trip………. it doesn’t take much&nbsp; convincing.</font></font>

<p><b>Transportation as an 'artform' .</b></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drive
north into the city on deserted streets for a while. I see human forms
sleeping on the grass beside parked </font><font color="#99FF99">rickshaws</font><font size=+1>
on some roads, the odd blanket covering them, sometimes not. A large black
object is slowly coming the other way, it is huge and hard to recognize.
We pass an elephant shuffling along, his mahout sitting high up on top.
Very impressive sight at 2 am…… it will be my last elephant. Then we are
on a main road surrounded by <font color="#FF0000">5 ton trucks</font>.
Not one seems to have tail lights, only the brakes flash occasionally.
It is surreal. All this chaos and no lights. They seem to know what they
are doing. From 6am to 9pm trucks and buses are not allowed into Delhi,
it would choke the city. Now they are making all their cargo deliveries
and pick ups.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I get to
my one star hotel (seems to be at least a 2 star to me),&nbsp; <font color="#66FF99">Hotel
Fifty Five</font>.&nbsp; It is at # 55 H block, <font color="#FFCCCC">Connaught
Circle</font>, right in the centre of Delhi. I will come to like this place
a lot, the staff are friendly, honest (see story at end)&nbsp; and Peter
always uses it for his tour groups. The price is 1100 rupees or about $
25 US single, and air conditioned. The rooms are small but clean. Even
though it is 3am there are&nbsp; staff still working. A boy carries my
gear up one floor to reception. I check in and get a bottle of&nbsp; pop
delivered for <font color="#33CCFF">19 rupees </font>, about fifty cents.
Room service here takes about 30 seconds.&nbsp; It has been 28 hours since
I left home, I am ready to sleep.</font></font>

out later why India uses the <font color="#33CCFF">two driver system</font>

and </font><font color="#99FF99">Henning</font><font color="#FFCCCC">,</font>
all&nbsp; from Germany.&nbsp; Henning owns an Enfield Bullet at home, while
Helmut rides a Yamaha sportbike. Richard has a Kawasaki and Uwe has a Harley
chopper, his first and only bike. He tells me later&nbsp; that after he
saw&nbsp; <font color="#33FF33">Easy Rider</font> as a teenager he decided
that was the only bike he would ever own, a chopper. He rides all over

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We head
out of Delhi at about 2am.&nbsp; The truck traffic is still going full
tilt.&nbsp; Our <font color="#66FF99">Sikh driver</font> jams the gears
hard&nbsp; while the relief man sleeps on a couch next to him. Lots of
passing on the 4 lane divided expressway, we have a&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">fourteen
hour , 600 km</font> trip ahead to reach <font color="#66FFFF">Nagar</font>
up in the foothills.&nbsp; Daylight comes as we head northwest across <font color="#FFCC33">Haryana
state</font> towards <font color="#CC66CC">Chandigar</font>, then turn
north and enter <font color="#00CC00">Punjab,</font> home of the Sikhs.
It is 6am and I have been watching India awaken for the last hour out my
window. Many families sleeping outside on flat rooftops, wooden bedframes
strung with rope.&nbsp; It feels&nbsp; like I have<font color="#FF6600">
x-ray vision</font>,&nbsp; people are doing&nbsp; their morning rituals
as our bus passes by.&nbsp; Stretching arms on rooftops cots, yawning faces,
people riding bikes, donkeys, walking. <font color="#FFCCFF">Water buffalo</font>
tied in front yards. People squatting in the fields, water jug in one hand
to wash with when they finish…..&nbsp;&nbsp; no toilet paper here.&nbsp;
I slowly come to realize during the trip that they may be onto a good thing.&nbsp;
India is organic, that’s for sure.&nbsp; In some places they have even
banned plastic bags……&nbsp; less garbage to blow around .</font></font>

rivers</font> disgorging the rain and silt from the <font color="#66FFFF">Himalayas</font>.
Our relief driver is shifting down much more often now.&nbsp; The scenery

very sweet, and the food is excellent.&nbsp; I share a room with <font color="#66FFFF">Henning

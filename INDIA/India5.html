Up early and off to Jispa.&nbsp; Today will be a long run, 175 kms south
over 2 mountain passes…… Lachulung La and Baralach La, or as Uwe always
calls it....... Barala-la-la. The trip is fairly uneventful as we pass
many familiar spots like our old campsite at Sarchu. We come into a tent
village just north of Baralach La pass. It sits in a valley by a lake called
Yunam Tso and has beautiful red mountains around it.&nbsp; There is an
Indian army recovery truck towing the remains of a ten ton cargo truck.
It had rolled down the mountain somewhere north of us and looked as flat
as a pancake. Apparently only one person died, one escaped.</font></font></font>

Here we meet up with Patrick from California, who is leading a Lotus tour
group of British and American bikers north on the same route.&nbsp; They
have Bullets also, but lack the large leather saddle bags Peter has installed.

Gear is bungeed on the back. There is only one support jeep, so the cooking
crew can not go on ahead to find camp like ours. One British rider told
me about some cracked ribs he got in a fall farther south. His chest is
wrapped up but he is soldiering on ok. They have ridden all the way from
New Delhi which is a steep learning curve with high density traffic.&nbsp;
I knew that Lotus charges about $ 5200 US for this trip ( price may be
lower now ), and Peter’s Classic Bike Adventures only $ 2550. I suddenly
realize how well prepared Peter is compared to some other operations. His
equipment has been fine tuned over many years, and he has done his homework.
Also, he is local, and avoids the extra commission of a US head office
booking clients and taking a large cut.&nbsp; I am glad to be with Peter’s
group regardless of the language challenge.</font></font></font>

Richard hands out envelopes to all the camp crew, and we thank them for
doing such a great job. They all seem very happy that we are satisfied
tourers. It is another nice sunny day until we climb up into the fog and
cloud on Rohtang La pass. Helmut follows me as he has done many times on
the trip, maybe curious to see what I will photograph next. He does not
carry a camera. I enjoy the company as we are often cruising along on our
own.&nbsp; I stay far behind the group and stop many times to take photos.</font></font></font>

Before I know it we are cruising along the Beas River through pine forests
towards Nagar. When we get back to the Ragini Hotel I know it is the end
of my two wheel trip. I feel very fortunate to have seen this remote area
and have the company of such a great a crew and riding companions. I am
very glad I came all this way. At night we have a big party on the roof
and Martin gets out the guitar. Lots of beer is drunk, and for me……… red
plum juice again.</font></font></font>

Today is a recovery day, we relax around Nagar. Three of us climb up the
hill to a very old temple. A friendly&nbsp; girl who lives there with her
family shows us around. She tells us that it has been occupied for 4000
years…… the passage of time has a different meaning in Asia…………</font></font></font>

Across the street from our hotel a truck dumps a load of hay. All day long
the family carries it up the stairs to their house where it will feed the
animals in their basement through the winter. On our last stay in Nagar,
Peter’s friend the hotel owner invited us to his home for a traditional
Kullu supper. We all sat on the floor at low folding tables which are ornately
decorated. His wife fed us amazing vegetarian food, with very few spices.
He tells us that in winter the animals are kept under the main floor which
is really the 2nd story level . This provides heat for the people above
!</font></font></font>

I visit the old Royal Palace next door to us, and take photos of the ornate

restored. I walk past the large plots of wild cannabis growing just below
its walls, and head down the steep road to Nagar village where we have
a restaurant meal under a huge parachute tent .</font></font></font>

At 4pm we say goodbye to Nyima and Tensing.&nbsp; I leave my Shoei helmet
with Tensing as a gift, glad to lighten my load.&nbsp; We walk down the
road to our charter bus which is too large to turn around up here. Peter
has booked one big enough for everyone to have four seats to sleep across,
with 8 rows we are all set.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As we pull out of Nagar a new journey begins and it will not be a short
one. There has been a lot of flooding here while we were gone. We pass
the narrow suspension bridge we took the bikes over 2 weeks ago, it is
now bare wires and the floor boards have been swept away. Normally it sits
15 feet above the water .</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two hours south we come to a long line of hundreds of vehicles. There has
been a landslide earlier and all traffic has come to a halt.&nbsp; It is
raining again so the outlook is not good. Peter tells the driver to turn
around and find a stretch of road that is safer to park on, we will wait
out the roadblock. The driver asks if he should start looking for a hotel
for us. Peter laughs and says…… “ these guys have been sleeping on the
ground for 2 weeks, this IS a hotel to them ”. The driver looks at us and
agrees.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All night the rain beats down and the river roars past below us. Apart
from the heavy snorers and the odd trip outside, it is an easy sleep. No
traffic goes by. There is some water coming in my window frame but not
enough to bother me. We all are stretched out across the aisle, so a trip
outside to the bathroom is an obstacle course of horizontal legs at crotch
height. It feels like crossing rows of fallen tree trunks that are a touch
too high.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the morning we head south and park at the back of the traffic jam. We
walk up the line a kilometer to view the slide. Mud and large rocks cover
the road,&nbsp; you can see more rocks rolling down the hill every so often.
It is very unstable until the rain stops. The odd rock bounces down the
mountain and into the river.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>I am
out of film so I cannot get any more photos. Back at the bus we weigh our
options. Tomorrow night Henning, Helmut, Richard and Uwe must be on the
plane to Vienna.&nbsp; I am more relaxed , I plan to see&nbsp; Delhi and
Agra so I have another four days.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Time to decide, the clock is ticking.&nbsp; Peter thinks the only option
is to hand carry our gear around the slide. We have been told there is
a second slide beyond this one a few kms, but we don’t know how far.&nbsp;
We all agree, it is better than waiting another day in the bus, we will
try to rent transport on the other side.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now&nbsp; I really appreciate my decision to travel light as we drag our
baggage down the road.&nbsp; We have only walked about 5 minutes when crowds
of people are coming towards us waving everyone back. A bulldozer has come
from the other side and we will be moving in the next few hours ……… good
kharma again !</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We get down to the next slide and wait a few hours for it to be cleared.
As we drive along the valley you can see huge sections of the hills that
have dropped into the river.&nbsp; The roads on the other side are cut
off also.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The rest of the trip is not interrupted, we drive all night and get back
to Hotel 55 at 4 am.&nbsp; It has taken 36 hours to get to Delhi…….&nbsp;
twenty hours more than the bus trip north .&nbsp; Henning and I share a
room one more night, tomorrow I will move to a single.</font></font></font>

Today Peter has arranged some touring in Delhi and a farewell supper at
a restaurant. We go to old Delhi in auto rickshaws and visit&nbsp; Jama
Masjid , (Friday Mosque) one of the largest in India. It was built in the
1640’s and was the final architectural extravagance of Mughal&nbsp; emperor
Shah Jahan. There is a huge courtyard that can hold 25,000 worshippers.
We are now barefoot and the hot stones are conveniently covered by long
narrow canvas sheets.</font></font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1></font></font></font>

Next we cruise the bazaar in old Delhi and pick up more souvenirs. Then
we decide to see the Red Fort. It is very hot and the taxi drivers have
their own agenda, they end up back near the hotel after chasing each other
for blocks. Peter gives up on the taxis, tells them what he thinks of their
games, and pays them off. By now we are all ready for a drink.</font></font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1></font></font></font>

After relaxing in the hotel, we walk down towards Connaught Circle, the
centre of town. We go upstairs to the Rodeo bar and restaurant at 12-A
Connaught Place. This is the funniest and most entertaining place I have
eaten in yet. It is suppertime and the place is hopping. All the waiters
are dressed in western gear, cowboy hats, and even toy six shooters in
leather holsters….. this is quite a sight for New Delhi !&nbsp; There are
families having birthdays, guys drinking beer and eating steaks, and people
like us having a party. All ages are there from 3 yrs and up. Over in one
corner is a big sound booth, and behind the glass window is a DJ who doesn’t
only spin music. He has a microphone stand and behind him is ……. a guitar
player !&nbsp;&nbsp; This guy can sing, and does a huge variety of rock
and roll, pop, you name it. He is so good that sometimes I think I am listening
to a tape instead until I look up to see him singing.&nbsp; It all seems
surreal behind glass in a restaurant. One thing I learned in Delhi is that
the food is fantastic and people have fun.&nbsp; From the high Himalayas
to the lower plains India knows how to cook and rock&nbsp; !</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We head home and I say goodbye to the rest of the gang, they will be in
the air by midnight. Peter will hop on a regular bus back to Manali, another
14 hour ride.</font></font></font>

I am up early at 630 to catch a tour bus to </font><font color="#FF99FF">Agra</font><font color="#FFFF00">,
four hours to the southeast. We stop at many 5 star luxury hotels to pick
up more tourists. These buildings make Hotel 55 look like a Tibetan parachute
tent …………… although&nbsp; I still prefer 55.&nbsp; I have decided to book
a day trip&nbsp; to the </font><font color="#33FF33">Taj Mahal</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp;
If you go to India do not miss it.&nbsp; Even if it is out of your way
you will not regret the experience.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The fellow next to me is a Dutch KLM 747 flight engineer, with his daughter
on a layover. There are people from 20 different countries on the bus.
We drive through the green countryside, very flat. Many amusing vehicles
go by including some Tata trucks that are just a </font><font color="#FFCCCC">chassis
and steering wheel</font><font color="#FFFF00">, being driven to the next
factory for bodywork I guess.&nbsp; We stop at another hotel for cold drinks
halfway down.</font></font></font>

We enter Agra and park, then are taken to the </font><font color="#66FFFF">Taj
Mahal </font><font color="#FFFF00">on a smaller bus. At the first entrance
Indian army soldiers search every bag.&nbsp; He feels my coat pockets and
asks what the lump is……… </font><font color="#FF6600">peanuts</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp;
No, they can’t go in so I drop them into a big garbage bin next to the
line. There is lots of other food in it. Maybe this is lunch for the army
!</font></font></font>

It is 38 degs C and high humidity, same as in Delhi most days. We walk
across the shady paths towards a large ornate gateway. When you walk through
this you are standing at the end of the famous picture you see all over
the world. It is a long way to the Taj and as I get closer I am amazed
that it is </font><font color="#CCFFFF">much bigger</font><font color="#FFFF00">
than you expect&nbsp; in real life. The dome alone is 80 meters high. Our
guide tells us the history of the Taj, and explains that the towers are
built leaning out slightly so that an </font><font color="#99FF99">earthquake</font><font color="#FFFF00">
would not topple them into the main temple. All 4 towers are closed now.
Three have seen suicides in the past, one by a couple who were not allowed
to marry. The </font><font color="#FF0000">fifth mughal emperor </font><font color="#33CCFF">Shah
Jehan</font><font color="#FFFF00"> took 22 years to build this monument
to his 2nd wife, </font><font color="#33FF33">Mumtaz Mahal</font><font color="#FFFF00">.
It was a love match, and she stayed with him for 18 years on all his journeys
and military expeditions. She died giving birth to her </font><font color="#FFCCCC">14th
child</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp; His subjects loved her as well,
and </font><font color="#66FFFF">twenty thousand people</font><font color="#FFFF00">
laboured to perpetuate her memory. It was finished in 1653.</font></font></font>

"Taj Mahal"</font><font color="#FFFF00"> (usually translated as either
"Crown Palace" or "Crown of the Palace") is an abbreviated version of her
name, Mumtaz Mahal (Exalted One of the Palace).&nbsp; Our guide tells us
that the emperor’s plans were to build a black monument across on the other
shore of the Yamuna River for his own resting place, but it was not to
be……..</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“A power struggle among his sons ensued, and eventually, the ruthless prince
</font><font color="#66FFFF">Aurangzeb</font><font color="#FFFF00">
deposed Shah&nbsp; Jehan in a coup d'etat in 1658. Shah Jehan was imprisoned
in the </font><font color="#FFCCCC">Octagonal Tower of the Agra Fort </font><font color="#FFFF00">(a
beautiful&nbsp; addition to the fort that he himself had constructed) and
would remain there until his death, eight years later, in 1666.&nbsp; He
was then buried next to his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, in the Taj Mahal, </font><font color="#33FF33">two
kilometers down river</font><font color="#FFFF00"> from the fort.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We take off our shoes and climb up the stairs onto the main plaza that
surrounds the Taj. Inside is a very ornate marble tomb surrounded by an
intricately carved marble fence, like lacework.&nbsp; The real bodies are
buried in another tomb one floor below. These ones, built at the same time,&nbsp;
are just a representation of the actual crypt.</font></font></font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="pillar.jpg" height=346 width=332></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I marvel at the inlaid stone designs on the outside walls, how the writing
uses forced perspective, larger at the top so it all looks equally sized
from below. The six sided pillars have a </font><font color="#33FF33">herringbone
pattern</font><font color="#FFFF00"> that produces an optical illusion,
they look like a </font><font color="#66FFFF">12 sided star</font><font color="#FFFF00">,
even from only a few feet away. As we leave the grounds I have a feeling
that this is the most beautifully laid out and proportioned feat of architecture
I will ever see.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Next we travel to the </font><font color="#FF0000">the Agra fort</font><font color="#FFFF00">
and visit this huge red sandstone complex. We stand inside the room where
he was imprisoned and the guide shows us a small hole in a pillar. Pried
out of it long ago was a precious stone which acted as a correction lens
for his failing eyesight. Through it he could gaze on the </font><font color="#33FF33">Taj
Mahal</font><font color="#FFFF00"> in the distance where his wife was buried.</font></font></font>

Our last stop (no surprise to me) is a marble factory where craftsmen create</font><font color="#66FFFF">
inlaid tabletops</font><font color="#FFFF00"> of every size and shape for
export . We are shown how they inlay the small coloured flats of stone
by hand,&nbsp; and walk through a huge showroom. Prices range from a few
dollars for glass coasters to </font><font color="#FFCCCC">$ 15,000 </font><font color="#FFFF00">for
huge tabletops. This is beautiful work but far beyond my tastes. They will
ship anywhere in the world and are eager to sell.</font></font></font>

Off we go back to Delhi. I manage to get a picture of a </font><font color="#33FF33">family
of four on a Vespa scooter</font><font color="#FFFF00">, although I did
see five from the bus window. We stop for supper at the same hotel again
and the buffet is another work of art. Coming from the trip to Ladakh I
really feel the contrast from my tenting days.&nbsp; I get home at about
11pm.&nbsp;&nbsp; For about $ 40 US&nbsp; it has been an amazing day and
well worth it.</font></font></font>

Today I take it easy. I spend the morning walking around </font><font color="#CCFFFF">Connaught
Circle</font><font color="#FFFF00">. I eat breakfast again at Nirula’s
restaurant, then go to </font><font color="#33FF33">DishNet</font><font color="#FFFF00">
and for 90 rupees ($2) an hour I use a fast internet. It is air conditioned
and has thirty computers.&nbsp; In&nbsp; seconds I am into hotmail in </font><font color="#FF9900">California</font><font color="#FFFF00">,
and then extract my house mail from </font><font color="#33CCFF">Nova Scotia</font><font color="#FFFF00">
through hotmail…….. sure do love this technology !</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the afternoon I find a barber shop and get the full meal deal. Wash,
cut, then a ten minute full scalp massage…… zzzzzzzzzzzz.&nbsp; These guys
are good. That runs 90 rupees and he spends at least half an hour on me.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tonight I will fly home.&nbsp; I have arranged for the same </font><font color="#33FF33">Sikh
driver </font><font color="#FFFF00">to take care of me today, he is attached
to the hotel as a freelancer.&nbsp;&nbsp; First I go to settle my bill
at the front desk. The manager gets my balance, I calculate it should be
3 nights at 1100 rupees per night, about $75 total.&nbsp; He says that
</font><font color="#66FFFF">they
owe me</font><font color="#FFFF00"> 1100 rupees.&nbsp;&nbsp; It turns out
that Peter has prepaid the group rooms and there was extra left over so
I will only need to pay for two nights.&nbsp; This is typical of my whole
time in India, but again I am surprised.&nbsp; How many hotels would volunteer
that information ?&nbsp; Peter told me very early that this hotel has never
let him down and now I believe it. They are efficient, well priced and
</font><font color="#FFCC00">HONEST.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My driver takes me and my bags to the </font><font color="#33FF33">Baha’i
Lotus Temple </font><font color="#FFFF00">where I want to spend the afternoon.
He will return later and take me to the airport. We have a nice drive south
into the suburbs and I leave him at the gates and walk into the gardens.&nbsp;
There are many people coming in by the bus load. The Lotus Temple has had
</font><font color="#66FFFF">50
million visitors to date</font><font color="#FFFF00">, more than the </font><font color="#FFCCCC">Eiffel
Tower</font><font color="#FFFF00"> and even the </font><font color="#FF0000">Taj
Mahal</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp; On one day alone it set a record
of 150,000.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have&nbsp; only seen two other Baha'i temples, in </font><font color="#99FF99">Sydney,
Australia</font><font color="#FFFF00"> and in </font><font color="#FF99FF">Wilmette,
Chicago</font><font color="#FFFF00">. This is the most spectacular of this
faith's nine sided temples.&nbsp; It was built between 1980 and 1987 to
resemble a lotus flower and designed by a Canadian architect who was born
in Iran, </font><font color="#FF0000">Mr. Fariburz Sahba</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp;
It is 200 feet in diameter and 100 feet high. The petals are made of white
concrete. On the exterior the petals are clad in </font><font color="#FFFFFF">white
Greek marble</font><font color="#FFFF00"> panels. It is surrounded by </font><font color="#33FF33">nine
reflecting pools.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I spend the afternoon inside the large prayer hall which can hold 1300
people, and walking around the 26 acre grounds. The staff is very friendly
and I spend some time in the library talking with a Baha'i from Africa
who has taught with a Canadian friend of mine at the Baha'i school in India.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before I know it my taxi driver has returned and comes looking for me in
the temple.&nbsp; We carry my baggage out together and head off to the
airport.&nbsp; I am early, my plane leaves at 2am but I don't mind waiting.&nbsp;
I won't be bored, there are always lots of people to watch in India !</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are driving down a crowded boulevard, 3 lanes on each side. The traffic
is very heavy and not moving more than 30 mph. There are cows eating grass
on the centre divider here and there, you see them anywhere in the city.
Suddenly the cars and trucks ahead </font><font color="#33FF33">are going
beserk</font><font color="#FFFF00">, all over the road trying to avoid
something.&nbsp; My driver starts muttering and getting ready.&nbsp; Out
of the mayhem ahead emerge</font><font color="#66FFFF"> two cows</font><font color="#FFFF00">.
They are running down the road straight at us , one on top of the other
hanging on for dear life.&nbsp; We manage to miss them as they gallop by
on 6 legs.&nbsp; Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.......... the expression
</font><font color="#FFCCCC">"
Better to run down your own mother than hit a cow. "&nbsp;</font><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;
has a lot of truth to it.&nbsp; If&nbsp; 5 ton trucks can miss them on
a city street then the motivation must be very high !</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I&nbsp; sit in the airport terminal for a few hours and watch life around
me.&nbsp; People fly out with&nbsp; parcels, some too large to go through
the x-ray machine. I see one lady with a cardboard box the size of a small
kitchen table that keeps sliding off her trolley on the way to the check-in
desk. Later in the cafeteria I watch the sun go down. It disappears into
the brown haze long before it sets, a small glowing </font><font color="#FF0000">red
ball</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp; I know it's time to go home.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When I think back Delhi has been more fun than I ever expected. The trip
to Ladakh will be a biking memory forever.&nbsp; Everywhere I went the
people were great. I am constantly amazed at the friendliness&nbsp; and&nbsp;
the </font><font color="#FF99FF">Tibetans </font><font color="#FFFF00">are
phenomenal.&nbsp; Yes, you may get the occasional stomach problems,&nbsp;
strange food (usually very good) , and in your face street hawkers or people
begging, but to me, </font><font color="#33FF33">India is still another
planet</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp; If you enjoy life there as you
wander through it, appreciate the people, the colours, the smells and the
sounds, you will have a good time.</font></font></font>

get a short course on starting the <font color="#66FFFF">Royal Enfield
Bullet</font> 500 cc singles. Gas on, switch on, pull in the compression
release, kickstart slowly to turn over until the ammeter swings ,&nbsp;&nbsp;
compression release off, then give a good hard boot down on the kickstarter
( same as&nbsp; my <font color="#FF0000">Triumph</font> and <font color="#33FF33">AJS</font>
in the late 60’s ). Half of us succeed, others need help. By the 3rd day
we will mostly have the ritual figured out. Peter lets us loose on the
steep hotel road. The locals seem to know exactly what is going on, and
they keep their distance while we drive on the right…..oops…. left, getting
it cemented into foggy minds with jet lag.&nbsp; <font color="#FFCCCC">Brakes…..
now what side were they on again ?</font>&nbsp; The front is adjusted loose
on purpose for the miles of dirt head, the rear has been upgraded for the
high mountain passes. After half an hour of riding , we leave for a nice
<font color="#CC66CC">40
km loop ride</font> around Manali, the local tourist centre in the <font color="#33CCFF">Kullu
Valley</font>. We ride across the <font color="#FF0000">Beas river</font>
on a small wooden suspension bridge only 8 feet wide with a good sag in
the middle…..&nbsp; ( this will later be minus all it’s decking after a
major flood rolls through the valley while we are gone ).</font></font>

the north side of the river , which is a smaller road with less traffic

for a 3 year old girl&nbsp; who has just run out into the road with no

Heading up tp Rhotang La</b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>There are cows to look out
for, sometimes wandering down the road. They have little fear of vehicles….
I guess the Indian custom of <font color="#FF0000">avoiding them at all
cost</font> has conditioned them to a low stress level.&nbsp; Someone in
India told me that " it would be <font color="#66FFFF">better to run down&nbsp;
your own mother </font><font color="#FFFF99">than a cow</font> ".&nbsp;
We stop for one of our regular breaks part way up the mountain at a food
stall.&nbsp; There are old fur coats lined up on a rack for rent, plus
lots of rubber boots under them.&nbsp; Many Indians come up from the lowlands
on day trips, and go trekking up into the hills.&nbsp; So far the road
has all been good bitumen with some dirt patches as we near the summit.</font></font>

Mound of Skulls) </font>at 13,000 ft.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are horses for
hire, and people all around. It is a busy little place. This is the furthest
many local tourists will come, just beyond the green belt so to speak.
Now we start descending into the <font color="#66FFFF">Chandra river valley</font>.
The north side of the pass is much more rugged, the road becomes more broken,
with mostly dirt and gravel . There are no trees to be seen, it is <font color="#FFCCFF">rock
and rivers</font>. Ahead of us to the north is the <font color="#33FF33">Great
Himalayan range</font>, with many peaks over 6000 meters, almost 20,000

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drive
down 3,000 ft into the <font color="#C0C0C0">Lahaul valley</font> and stop
at a village called <font color="#FF6666">Khoksar </font>for a tea break.
Lots of small stalls and food choices for the trucks and travelers. Tea
is 5 rupees.&nbsp; Then we cross the bridge to the north side and head
northwest up the valley. We stop at <font color="#66FFFF">Keylong,</font>
a large village&nbsp; for soup and noodles. It is crowded and we park the
bikes near the buses by a large dirt embankment. Unfortunately this spot
is also the <font color="#FFCC00">public washroom</font> for passengers
with nowhere else to go, and the urine heavy air that wafts around us is
hard to take. Definitely a low point on the trip, and one we never repeated
again . In the mountains you do what you have to do for facilities, there
usually are none so you get used to turning your back to the road&nbsp;
and waiting for a lull in the traffic. No one seems to mind. Helmut stays
on his bike with his head on the bars, <font color="#33FF33">waiting to
escape</font>. He has some of the recurring stomach problems we will all
get in India .&nbsp; I&nbsp; find it only mildly annoyi<font color="#FFFF99">ng,

are all the fuel tankers heading north loaded. We will pass dozens of both
in the next 2 weeks, as well as the regular buses. Luckily the spaces here
are large, so the traffic density is low. Overtaking on the narrow cliff

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;The weather continues
sunny, and the bikes are running well. Ashok has checked them at night,
filled oil and gas plus fixed a bad clutch. I give him a spare adjustable
wrench I brought with me.&nbsp; He obviously will be doing all the wrenching
anyway and I have&nbsp; more at home. My only repair on the trip will be
a broken speedo cable, the second time Martin and I just wrap it around
the handlebar .</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stop

road in the Alps, lots of hairpins and no nasty gravel surprises. When
we get to the top it is about 5 degs C at&nbsp; 16,500 ft. Sunny and time
for more pictures.&nbsp; You can feel the change in the air when you walk,
it takes deeper breaths now to get from one spot to another. We are now

up to another sunny day. The monsoons are less of a threat to us now, the
altitude and mountains keep them behind us to the our south. We head for
the border of Ladakh proper, where we will leave Himachal Pradesh state.
When we arrive at the army checkpost there are a lot of civilian trucks
parked off to the side, not a good sign. We learn that there is a serious
problem ahead and the road is closed. Some terrorists have commandeered
a truck to the west of us over the Zanskar range, and gunned down three
Buddhist monks who stopped it near a monastery.&nbsp; An German tourist
hitchhiking in the truck is also missing , only his papers have been found.
( his body is found 3 weeks later on a glacier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......
the high price of being an eye witness ).&nbsp; The area is very tense,
police fear that rioting may break out in Leh, the capital, between the
Buddhist and Moslem population. A curfew has been imposed at night, and
all roads in and out closed until further notice. This is not looking good.</font></font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We decide
to wait for a few hours and see if anything changes. Peter tells everyone
that this situation could last for hours.......&nbsp; or days.&nbsp; We
should consider an alternate plan. People on the road ahead are stuck in
Pang, halfway between two high passes, where facilities are primitive.
If we get north and they close the road again, we will be stuck there too.&nbsp;
The army controls Pang, and no one leaves after 2pm on normal days. This
allows trucks coming down off both passes a clear road into Pang.&nbsp;
By afternoon there is still no change at the border so we take a vote,
we will run south over Baralach La again to Jispa and take hotel rooms
to get clean and plan strategy. We may have to head southeast through the
Kunzom Pass to the Spiti valley loop. We have limited fuel and must decide
soon on which roads we will burn it.&nbsp; The mood is dark, no one in
the group wants to quit yet and lose our goal of Khardung La and the highest
roads. This is the main reason we are here.</font></font>

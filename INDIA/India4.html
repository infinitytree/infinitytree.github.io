We check out of the hotel and ride the main road west towards </font><font color="#33FF33">Kargil</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp;
Just outside town we stop at a military museum next to the Leh airport
which is dedicated to the </font><font color="#FF99FF">mountain war between
India and Pakistan</font><font color="#FFFF00">. Here at the top of the
world they are still fighting artillery duels.&nbsp; The upper floor has
displays of&nbsp; battles on the </font><font color="#66FFFF">Siachen Glacier</font><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;
100 kms to the northwest. At </font><font color="#FF0000">22,000 ft</font><font color="#FFFF00">
they are still lobbing artillery rounds at each other.&nbsp; It is the
highest battlefield on earth, and India loses more men to pulmonary edema,
cerebral edema and altitude sickness than it does to the enemy.&nbsp; I
see equipment on display from many countries…..Canada, Germany, Austria
are a few. Mostly climbing gear and winter clothes........&nbsp; the white
coats and snow boots are from Canada.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Later we sit outside next to the airport and watch a </font><font color="#33FF33">Tupelov
Indian Army transport jet</font><font color="#FFFF00"> come in to land.&nbsp;
I put a 135mm lens on my Pentax to see it more clearly as it crosses the
other end of the long runway.&nbsp; Suddenly I hear Peter yell&nbsp; </font><font color="#66FFFF">"

Oops, I forgot and stow the camera back in it’s case. So much for my telescope

We travel along the </font><font color="#66FFFF">Indus river valley</font><font color="#FFFF00">
as it flows downhill away from us and see a drier country with large brown
expanses each side of the road. Only the strip of green along the river
and the odd village break up the landscape. On our left is the river and
formidable </font><font color="#FFCCCC">Zanskar mountains</font><font color="#FFFF00">
, and on the right is the Ladakh range both over 18,000 ft.&nbsp; We come
to a stop overlooking the confluence of the brown turbulent Zanskar river
plunging&nbsp; into the Indus 500 feet below us. There is a large group
of people on the beach with trucks, buses and horses.&nbsp; I see large
shiny reflector boards bouncing the fill light off the sun into the actors
shadow side ...........&nbsp; a feature film being made !</font></font></font>

There are dozens of </font><font color="#FF0000">monks in red robes</font><font color="#FFFF00">

Off to the side is a tent with food on tables where people lounge on chairs
until their turn comes before the camera. I notice an odd </font><font color="#33CCFF">squared
off truck</font><font color="#FFFF00"> we saw days ago when it passed us
at night near Sarchu, it was unlike any other Indian truck I had seen on
the road. I now realize it is the generator truck, parked farther away

concrete bridge. We pass a field where a man is </font><font color="#66FF99">threshing
grain on an old gas powered machine</font><font color="#FFFF00">, the women
are carrying freshly cut bundles to him. We backtrack 2 miles along the

behind it and stay here for 2 nights as our basecamp.&nbsp; Tomorrow is
a day trip to </font><font color="#FF6600">Lamayuru and the Fotu La pass</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp;
I wander down to the river by the large stone walls of the monastery. There
are hundreds of&nbsp; beautiful prayer stones along the top of the&nbsp;
wall, all carved by hand.&nbsp; I suspect it represents a few hundred years

After wandering around the temple and looking at the carved wooden statues
and paintings, I go up the street in this small village to a </font><font color="#66FFFF">large
open air water tap</font><font color="#FFFF00">. It comes down from the
hills nearby and spills out the pipe into the street. There are kids bathing
under it , and ladies washing clothes. I wait my turn and put my head under
for a few seconds then walk away so others can use it. After shampooing
I go back and rinse off. Feels great. </font><font color="#FF0000">The
people smile and laugh</font><font color="#FFFF00">, everywhere we go in
Ladakh it is friendly like this.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Soon we gear up the bikes and head west again to </font><font color="#99FF99">Photu
La</font><font color="#FFFF00"> , our last pass and a famous monastery,
Lamayuru.&nbsp; We follow the Indus river west again and stop at another
army post to have our papers checked. There is a policeman on a </font><font color="#CCFFFF">smaller
350cc Bullet</font><font color="#FFFF00"> who is just leaving, and we follow
him. Soon we are climbing an incredible series of hairpin bends called
the </font><font color="#FF6600">Hanging Loops</font><font color="#FFFF00">
up a mountain.</font></font></font>
<center>

<p><b><font color="#33FF33">Hanging&nbsp;&nbsp; Loops</font></b></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think there are about 40 of them. Our bikes are </font><font color="#FF0000">faster</font><font color="#FFFF00">
and I pass the 350 Bullet early. I have a feeling he is trying to keep
up with our bigger bikes but soon lose him in my mirrors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later,
partway up the mountain I stop to take a photo and notice our </font><font color="#FF99FF">jeep</font><font color="#FFFF00">
parked far below me with one of our bikes.&nbsp; The 350 is in the ditch
and our guys are helping the policeman.&nbsp; I find out later that he
was riding too fast </font><font color="#66FFFF">trying to keep up with
us</font><font color="#FFFF00"> but is ok. He decides to turn around and
go back.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At one point following the others, we squeeze by another loaded truck,
one of hundreds we have overtaken on this tour. I am the last in a string
of 5 bikes and riding just behind </font><font color="#66FF99">Helmut</font><font color="#FFFF00">.
As usual, there is very little room between the truck and the inside cliff
wall and ditch on the right.&nbsp; We make our standard&nbsp; dash through
the diesel smoke and dust along the </font><font color="#FF99FF">3 foot
wide path</font><font color="#FFFF00">. Helmut gets halfway past the truck
then rides up over two flat rocks , </font><font color="#FF0000">each as
big as a large book</font><font color="#FFFF00">. One of them flies back
about 2 feet off the ground but&nbsp; I manage to miss it when it lands.
</font><font color="#33CCFF">Somehow
Helmut hangs on</font><font color="#FFFF00">. We are often inches from
the truck or bus wheels during these stunts, on one occasion the driver
started to turn my way at the last moment. I could see the large tire&nbsp;
coming my way and I had to put my hand on his front fender as I finished
passing.&nbsp; </font><font color="#33FF33">Somehow this has all started
to feel normal .</font></font></font>

When we get to </font><font color="#99FF99">Lamayuru </font><font color="#FFFF00">there
is a huge festival going on. Buses full of pilgrims have arrived and the
courtyard is filled with monks and tourists. An </font><font color="#FF0000">immense

the side of the building, it must be 50 ft long.</font></font></font>

The huge </font><font color="#99FF99">Tibetan trumpets</font><font color="#FFFF00">
are being carried by two monks each, their deep sound is earthshaking.
The local women have those wonderful Tibetan hats with the curled up corners.
I try to get a good photo of a lady in profile, but even with my long lens
it is not possible today.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
15 kms after Lamayuru we climb to the top of </font><font color="#33CCFF">Fotu
La pass at 4094m</font><font color="#FFFF00">. This is the farthest we
will get from Nagar , </font><font color="#FF0000">667 kms away</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp;
I take a photo of two trucks coming west with lots of people waving on
top.&nbsp; This is the main route to </font><font color="#99FF99">Srinagar
</font><font color="#FFFF00">,
and shorter than Manali. Most non strategic goods come this way, fruit,
chickens, people. Army supplies, troops and fuel come up </font><font color="#FFCCCC">NH
21 </font><font color="#FFFF00">to avoid Kargil where the </font><font color="#CC6600">mountain

begins</font><font color="#FFFF00">. This creates a new problem as the
paved sections up the hanging loops are all covered in oil from&nbsp; the
dozens of trucks clawing up the hills daily.&nbsp; For weeks there is no
rain here, and now I can </font><font color="#FF0000">feel the front wheel

to wonder if I will make it down, these are the </font><font color="#33CCFF">worst

Later I meet Peter and most of the others taking a break at a chai stop
and we head for Pang.&nbsp; We are on the More Plains again, lots of goats
and yaks. Another Bullet overtakes us, some </font><font color="#FFCCFF">crazy
tourist guy</font><font color="#FFFF00"> with his girlfriend hanging on
for life.&nbsp; Later we see them by the side of the road. </font><font color="#FF0000">The
goat they have just hit</font><font color="#FFFF00"> has run off. The bike
has been down but nothing seems bent too much.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><i><font color="#33FF33">If

We arrive in Pang after the </font><font color="#CCFFFF">2pm deadline</font><font color="#FFFF00">
when they shut down outbound traffic, so we are basically stuck there until
the next day. </font><font color="#FFCCFF">The army will not let us one

by the river, I think they know we would probably keep going.&nbsp; We
are forced to put up the tents on the only flat area, behind the parachute
store village of the </font><font color="#FF0000">Tibetan locals</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp;
Unfortunately this is also an area used for other things. I call it ‘ Tenting
on the shit fields of Pang ’.&nbsp; We manage to avoid the worst areas,
but I also know that everything dries and turns to dust very fast up here.
</font><font color="#66FFFF">Best
not to wonder</font><font color="#FFFF00"> how much of these airborne organics
are flying around us.&nbsp; It is windy, so we tie the eating tent to both
jeeps again.&nbsp; After supper everyone hits the sack early.</font></font></font>
